you can also program your weight loss goals, and that it tells you how many calories you can take in, and how long it will take to take it off.  it will also tell you if you're trying to lose weight too fast.... love this app!!!"

i’m so disappointed i renewed for a year and now am stuck with this clunky app for 10 more months. i can’t customize micronutrient target la in a way that won’t give me the warning notice, can’t cycle calories in a functional way, and can’t enter the program i am following with doctor because it is out of their specs. 
despite claims to be customizable, pro doesn’t meet my needs. i’ve much prefered using  other well known apps."

total ease and total awareness is the gift of this app. if you use it.

i have used it, faithfully, and i detest tracking food. always resisted. my brick wall.

i got serious, changed my attitude and paired this with a fitbit adding exercise daily.  in 5 weeks have lost 16 pounds. i am eating really good food. moving my body the way i need to. i cannot even believe it. 

by the way, my ""activity"" is dancing around the house every morning to my kinda loud favorite music and picking the house up at the same time.  plus walking.  simple.

improvement requests:  1. favorite food list should always include all foods tracked, any meal or snack, any time.  2. last update has a small glitch on iphone 5c... click on the new calendar and it transparently shades bottom half of screen sometimes kicking you out. i just don't go there. 3. have non metric options available more often in food data. 
you are doing a great job with this app! keep it up. the simplicity is why it works + huge data base."

it's very customizable & informative.
i have been able to stop taking some vitamins and decrease others because i can now see that i'm getting from the food i eat. if i'm not sure sure about any vitamin, or mineral or aminos or anything i can tap on it and get more info. 
the scanning of the barcodes is what i use most. the ai picture taking works great when eating out.
i know that there is more to this app that i have not tapped into yet and i've been using for 2 months already. worth every cent."

it really works. if you don’t track your calories, you’ll never lose weight.

the app was already good 10 years ago but now after using it again i see it has gotten so much better. one of my favorite new features is ability for ai to scan my plate and calculate the calories. this is just amazing.

i love that the developers did not rest on the laurels and kept on improving the product.

i also like the feature where i can scan a barcode on a package and it recognizes what it is.

i like the ability to log into it via the website, ipad app, or iphone app. not too many people like tracking their calories, but this app at least makes it easy and if you do and you work out, you will achieve your goals."

configuring the calories a day is impossible either. whatever you set up, the “advanced algorithm” is gonna tell you that your daily caloric intake is below bmr, always.

then, it asks you if you want it to update the caloric intake, nothing happens. and finally you go to the amount of calories to change it to whatever it tells you, it’s grayed out.

frustrating, impossible to use. i’d rather keep telling chatgpt what i eat with my voice (super practical) and let it calculate my calories and macronutrients.

i do wish the app would allow me to enter my sleep time in hours and minutes instead of using the decimal system.  just a minor annoyance. asked a developer about this several years ago. he got a little testy and defensive with me.  not that important to me, so i let it drop.

 what is the point of an app that lets you track caffeine then when you put in your coffee it says n/a? i wrote them about this and the initial response was basically that can't be right! (in agreement with me). then they came back and said that if the particular coffee's package doesn't have its caffeine on there, then they don't include it. so when you look at your caffeine total for the day it's going to say zero if you put in a specific brand that didn't put the caffeine amount on it. how many bags of coffee have you seen that put their caffeine amount on there? if you put in just black coffee in the search field, then it will give you the caffeine. as far as i know, all black coffee has the same amount of caffeine…
 another example of this is n/a for added sugars. i put in a chocolate bar that says on its own label that it has 9 g of added sugar, and the app put n/a for added sugars. clearly the caffeine and sugar with these, are not ""not applicable"". it makes tracking either of these not only worthless, but potentially misleading when you look at your day's totals. don't put n/a, put unknown, or more honestly ""we don't know"" or ""unavailable at this time"". 
 i'm not alone. people are more concerned than ever about added sugars. sugar that occurs in something naturally, is not a problem. so i'm not worried about those sugars, i'm worried about added sugars (refined and unrefined)."

i have been using this app for almost 3 years daily to track my food, weight an water intake. as someone who has lost and maintained 115lb weight loss nutrition is very important to me and this app helps keep me on track. i’d like to update and modify this review. i find as of late many many products are not in the system or are entered incorrectly. it takes time for me to send in the proper info. i feel like their should be monitoring and accuracy checks as it’s very clogged with inaccuracy. i also find much of the info conflicting. i am told to eat more this or that as i was “low”, i eat it and then i am flagged for eating said food. as a chronically ill person i would like to be able to skip meals or days when i am too ill to eat and the app recognize i didn’t eat due to illness and modify my weekly plan to accommodate that. i would also like to i overall love the app but it definitely needs tweaking and adjustments."

9605053570,2023-02-10 19:47:41-07:00,fan in hawaii,5,self accountability,"this program absolutely works not only to take weight off but to keep it off. it’s simple, really. you record in the program how much you want to weigh by what date, and it gives you a daily calorie budget. you get to add calories for calories earned by exercising. then you enter every bit of food all day long and weigh yourself every day.  if you stay under your calorie budget, you lose weight. a great tool is to enter something before you eat it to see what that will do to your “bottom line.” you can still eat it — you just see what the result will be. and the program tracks nutrients as well. and if the calorie budget is just too strict for you to maintain, you just adjust your expectations — push your target date out a month, or raise your target weight. i lost 30 pounds during the first year and a half of covid, starting in october 2021. it’s now february 2023 and the weight is still off. if you use the program, you’re accountable to yourself. it’s simple and powerful."

i was happy to have the scanner and love the way this app is laid out.  it was easy to learn and use.  
however, i did not personally respond well to the constant shaming of yellow and red days, they occur when you go over your calorie goal,  which you look at for an entire week before they are off of your home screen.  i found that shaming and not at all encouraging.  i know when i over eat - i don’t need to be reminded all week of making a mistake.  i personally found that feature very discouraging.  i would not recommend this app to anyone with an eating disorder.
the constant grading of food was also a little much.  access to healthy choices can often be limited in daily life.  some people can’t afford fresh fruits and vegetables.  
please find ways to make this app encouraging for all. do not be part of the fat shaming culture. 
if those changes were made this app could be an awesome resource for weight loss.

(the submitting process worked, but for some reason it was rejected.) ***** i first downloaded this app out of curiosity of my daily sodium intake. i didn't change how i ate, i simply (and honestly) tracked it. i was blown away when i found out that i was consuming 3x the recommended amount. and that's without eating obvious culprits, like french fries and potato chips! so i've been choosing lower-sodium foods for about 2 1/2 weeks now. i'm feeling great- i don't feel bloated (i didn't even realize that i was feeling bloated before) and have lost 3 pounds. i'm sure the main reason for my success is that i'm writing everything down that i eat. also, a lot of the bad-for-me foods happen to be loaded with sodium. mynetdiary makes it super easy to track what you've eaten, including water intake and calories burned via exercise. when you scan a barcode, you see a ""food score"" that helps make healthier choices on the fly. i'm even able to create recipes and it calculates the nutrition value for me. the only cons for me are: 1. caffeine intake for some reason is not tallied. it gives me the option, but it does not work. 2. for some reason, my vitamin a total is always listed as impossibly high. i've done the math, and it's incorrect. 3. the analysis section contains very good information, but is a little hard to understand. they just need to have a copywriter help them figure out how to word things so it makes more sense. those three things are very minor flaws for me. the good parts of this app far outweigh the bad. i definitely recommend mynetdiary for anyone that cares about their body."

i have used now this app for 4 years!! i love this food diary!! i am maintaining my weight using this diary. it is very easy to enter the food (oz, cups, etc...). the program remembers your favorite food practically reads your mind 😂!! i myself like to weigh my food so it makes it so easy! it has so many bells and whistles like various charts to track weight, nutrition, etc.. it also gives you daily and weekly progress reports etc.. i started with the free version and then i liked it so much i paid a few dollars to have the pro!  well worth every penny! i do not have the monthly subscription to the advanced version . i feel i don’t need it. i have used several food diary apps before this one is hands down the best by far!! i very highly recommend!!"

      so i decided to count and track my calories to see what i’m doing, so i can adjust it for loosing weight.
    i could not believe how many calories i was consuming and my proportions were way out of control along with unconscious eating.
    so this app mynetdiary has been ultimately what i was looking for, logging everything i put into my mouth ( if you bite it you write it)…lol
   also it synced perfectly with my apple watch series 7 to monitor my steps and exercise . along with my iphone i can track anything i eat even scanning labels is so easy to use any where and anytime.
   so far i’ve lost 3.5 lbs in only a week, i will continue to use this app, i love it. i signed up and paid $59.00 for premium subscription, so i can change up my diet and there are so many fantastic recipes from all the different diets to use right at my fingertips.
    the amount of information on this app from videos to articles on every subject you can imagine, along with my tech is mind blowing and has set me up to be extremely successful!

8659899214,2022-05-11 05:57:33-07:00,macflagg,1,the classic widget removed.,"update:

the classic widget no longer seems to be available. this is a shame, because apple’s new widgets are garbage. they are not widgets at all. they are nothing more than app launchers that can display dynamic information. this isn’t even new to ios, as the calendar and clock apps have been able to do this for years.

i don’t want to launch the app when i want to clip some text or, in this case, add some water i’ve consumed. the whole point of widgets is that you don’t have to launch the app to do small tasks. 

with the classic widget, to add a glass of water to my daily intake, i could leave my phone laying on the table, then without picking it up, tap the screen once to wake the phone, swipe right to bring up the classic widgets, then tab the water symbol on mynetdiary’s widget to add a glass of water to my diet. that’s it. the task is completed in 3 simple gestures.

with the new widget, to add a glass of water to my daily intake, i have to pick my phone up, swipe right to bring up widgets, however, when i tap the water symbol instead of being done with my task, i have wait for faceid to authenticate me, then mynetdiary has to launch, then it opens the water sections of the app, then i have to tap the water symbol again to actually add the water, then i have to quit the app by swiping up, so i’m not in the app the next time i unlock my phone to do something else.

what a massive step backwards in convenience. this is why i’m dropping another star.

knocked off stars because of thirsty advertisements

this app used to be awesome and in many respects, it still is. but, the amount these developers nag you to upgrade to their subscription service has grown out of hand. almost every time you launch the app, your greeted with a thirsty advertisement. i’ve had their subscription service and there is nothing, i mean nothing compelling enough to justify their monthly fee. it’s worth $0.99 a month, at most. really, it’s not even really worth $0.99. it should be a $10-$15 app, as a one time fee. every ad that pops up make me hate this app a little more. the ads are what prompted me to write this review. likely, as these thirsty ads keep annoying me, i’ll drop my review to one star."

i realize the mynetdiary community may be mostly english, but adding nutrients in spanish shouldn’t be hard because the names are very similar to english (calorías -> calories, sodio -> sodium, fósforo -> phosphorus, etc).

if it’s not possible to hire people that can do this, at least let me add the data to the database myself.

the food scanner, the exercise & steps that's pulled from my health app works very well.
the grading on my food choices, help me to make better choices. the recipes as well as being able to enter amount of water i drink per day is a plus.

i'm unable to purchase a withings scale right now, so i'm not sure how that part would work.
but, i have no doubt that it will work well with this app.
i appreciate & thank the developers of this app, they put all they had into it❣️
may you all continue to accelerate❣️

1: you cannot set your own calorie goal.  for me it picked a bit over 1700.  i know from experience i will gain weight with anything over 1600.

2:  the choices for logging food are poor. 

3: it should pull date from the health app. why do i have to log my exercise when it is in the health app.

i must say, this app has been reliable and helped to keep me on track in all areas of my program. i lost 60 lbs my first go round, and  recently, the period of about one year, ( covid stress eating i’m sure), have gained about 10 lbs back. i am working on talking off about 8 of those 10 lbs( being older, i could do with a little more meat on the bones). 
i have no doubt i’ll be successful with the assistance of mynetdiary and god’s help.
thank you for your continued upgrade to all areas of the app.

7473441055,2021-06-16 21:29:20-07:00,whereverigogo,5,the best app ever!,"this app combines the best of all worlds. it’s super easy to dive right in and start using it right from the start. the interface and behaviors are (mostly) super intuitive and yet adaptive. once into the app for a few days, it’s 1000% customizable to be extremely efficient and meaningful — for my very wonky and self-focused needs. i can get this app to become precisely tuned in to the things that are most important to me. yet, it’s also engaging and as social (or anti-social) as i might want to be. most importantly…i’ve consistently been at my targets since i started using this - yay!"

7433081712,2021-06-06 04:26:39-07:00,user 777,5,needs updating,"after years of using this app, it now no longer works on ios version 14.6. it needs to be updated, or it will become useless."
7419984607,2021-06-02 19:44:57-07:00,diane wi,5,highly recommend,this is an excellent app. lots of great functions and in-depth analysis of your diet; you choose the settings. i love the barcode scanner; works very well on my iphone. i have been using this app consistently for years!! i feel no need to switch to another app.
7409524452,2021-05-31 04:59:40-07:00,gnoads,1,don’t bother buying pro version,"continues to remove functionality locking it behind subscription. annoying subscription popups. it appears the food advice still follows sad fda recommendations which is why this nation is so obese.

i acknowledge the gui is decent & intuitive. the devs got this right."
7401408767,2021-05-29 01:40:27-07:00,sarakmost,1,took away features,i used to really enjoy this app - actually have used it for almost 8 years! before the subscription model they had a ‘plus’ version which is what i purchased. now they took away features like seeing the detailed nutritional info for the day - that is unacceptable. stop being another cheap brand and listen to your customers needs.
7368607115,2021-05-20 21:47:32-07:00,phillsd,5,hotel ceo,i have never have had a knowledge base that gave me such complete information that clearly educates me and makes me accountable for my nutritional decisions. review
7355724754,2021-05-18 06:36:11-07:00,mnbobcat,1,awful app forces maximum weight loss,i haven’t used this app yet but right out of the gate i hate it because when configuring weight loss goals it allows a maximum of 2 pounds a week.  that’s ridiculous that the app doesn’t let me choose the number of pounds a week that i intend to lose.  i get that 1 or 2 pounds a week is the recommended rate but i easily lose 4 - 5 pounds a week and i want the app to reflect what fits me and not force something that’s not accurate
7347448196,2021-05-16 13:01:36-07:00,shreddedshrek,1,paywall in a “pro” app?,"i already paid for this app at the installation time. now all of a sudden, it’s asking me to subscribe premium if i want to see my macros for the day. i thought there was a difference in this pro version and the basic app, but apparently not. i feel like i’ve been tricked. there was no information about this paywall at the installation time either. is this some sort od a bug?"
7346002020,2021-05-16 06:03:32-07:00,umm laylah,5,on track ❤️,this app has really helped me keep track of what i’m eating and the calories i’m burning and i’m loving it!  2 1/2 weeks in the books and 13 pounds down!
7334736326,2021-05-13 12:26:58-07:00,itssakeeper,5,amazing and essential tool for my keto diet,"i've used this since it was introduced, over 10 years now.  it keeps getting better and better. now has better keto tracking options, flexible nutrient tracking, meds log, and getting better streamlined data entry. still want to option replace pie chart with net carbs instead of total carbs etc. annual subscription is high priced if you don't use all of the options. would love a mid priced version with choice of module parts."
7331344842,2021-05-12 16:08:11-07:00,kimba lion,5,how good the app,this app is the best i found for me to help me reduce weight and attain my goals.
7314061989,2021-05-08 12:02:03-07:00,surfreak29,5,no more freezing!,thank you for the bug fix. the app is working again on my iphone 😉super happy and appreciate your responsiveness
7308649755,2021-05-07 07:06:40-07:00,sgltrkmnd,5,awesome calorie tracker!,"i am working hard to get to a bmi in the teens. this is tough to do. you have to be strict to get there, especially while adding rigorous fitness to the plan.  counting calories is one of the best ways to manage nutrition and maintain course but it can really be a drag if you are not disciplined.  this app makes it easy to get to a sustainable diet, eat healthy, and feel sated.  tip: log your meals during or after every meal so you maintain consistency and don’t slip!"
7302964453,2021-05-05 17:48:18-07:00,happy user phil,5,6 years and i still love this app,"i have used this app dailey for 6 years, for ketogenic, standard, and low carb cycles. i use the tracking tools and the macro calculators are terrific. i pay for the full version and it is worth it."
7285897866,2021-05-01 10:47:27-07:00,emkat53,2,save the eggs,"i really like this app, especially with the pro features but eggs do not have trans fats and y’all need to straighten this out cuz i’m tired of seeing that lightbulb everyday. eggs are healthy and should have a higher food score.

update: been using this app for years. the newest update got rid of most of my frequently tracked foods. they’re no longer in the database. very disappointing as one of the best features of this app was the huge database and ease of autocomplete finding your frequent foods. hope this can be fixed."

7259359234,2021-04-24 10:16:02-07:00,gideonkain,5,great app but....,"with the childhood obesity problems across the nation, i wish all the features on this app were unlocked for 23 and younger who could show student status via school id. it would also be nice to have subscription charges waived for dod and military personnel to promote healthy eating and fitness. 

with that said, there are a lot of great features available in a single app. the only thing i would add is map services to local farmer’s markets and other fresh produce retail stores.

7240589625,2021-04-19 09:58:38-07:00,rossfamily59,4,great app,"i like the changes that have been made. 
need to add diet for diabetics. 
add diet for hashimoto’s disease. 

lastly, the plus sign ease of access is great, you can log breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc. but you forgot to put in weight log in, in this category. 

you have to fumble through the app to log your weight. it’s no longer on the front screen either to see your man slide down the hill! sad to see those changes. that was definitely a bad move. 😌"

7198664098,2021-04-08 08:23:11-07:00,kiteboardobx,4,it takes some practice but works great,i’m using this and it makes calorie counting easy.  i’m using a lot of prepared meals so the upc scanner is great.  also when making like a tuna salad just scan the can and the mayo then your done.  super easy.
7184980054,2021-04-04 20:02:25-07:00,casathome,2,frustrated,"i have been using the pro edition for years and have recommended it to too many people to count, as well as all of my doctors. however, the constant ads appearing every time i open the app is annoying to say the least. then tonight i am trying to enter my dinner and the app keeps closing. i try to sign in and it doesn’t recognize my email. that is your problem. i bought the app and should be able to use it without these issues. i need to use this in order to keep track of calories, sodium, potassium and phosphorus- in other words i have ckd. i will change the rating, or update, when, if, and how this issue is resolved. thanks."
