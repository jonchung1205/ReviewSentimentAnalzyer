13214250676,2025-10-02 08:47:05-07:00,twinklepuffluff,5,want to lose weight? it works,"losing weight is hard, and for many people, i think that navigating diet is difficult. knowing what to eat and what not to eat is one thing, but actually maintaining a calorie deficit for weight loss is another. i’ve used this app on and off for years, and while my dedication to weight loss waxes and wanes, every time i want to lose, this app produces results."
13213887391,2025-10-02 07:16:05-07:00,westbury19,5,the big compare,i logged my daily meal (including snacks) progress and exercise into 3 different calorie tracking programs and decided that mynetdiary best meets my needs and intuition.
13210455777,2025-10-01 11:50:24-07:00,tbaaaa..,1,needs to re-evaluate policy,"the app itself is amazing, simple to use, and includes every food under the sun. my problem is that i'm skinny fat, so even when i reached my target weight, i still had a massive belly. i tried to reduce my weight goal further, but was prevented from doing so because my bmi was classified as ""underweight."" this would be a good safety feature, except bmi does not take into account proportions of fat or muscle, and also varies by ethnicity. restricting weight loss goals based on bmi being under or over weight is ridiculous. i urge the devs to get rid of this restriction. the app was useless to me after this and i had to switch to a competitor. fix this! for south asians, for example, lean mass is much lower and fat proportion is much higher. this means they can look thinner and be a lower weight than normal and still be healthy, but they have to reach lower bmis and weights overall than are typically regarded as ""safe"" to lose the same level of fat as europeans, because the system is based on european average body types."

13156086906,2025-09-19 02:06:06-07:00,h2oh2oh20,5,mynetdiary is an awesome application !,"this is a most excellent and truly useful application :-)

i use it daily to keep track of all my health information: nutrition, exercise, and medications.

in addition, mynetdiary does a very good job of rolling out bug fixes, as needed. 

i recently noticed a small glitch - when i change the mnd chart color option on a medicine entry that had previously been saved, the entry disappears and a new entry of an identical name cannot be created because the application says the entry already exists :-)

overall, i’ve gotta say, this application is phenomenal.

a tip of the hat and my thanks to the developer(s) !"

when i use the ai scan functionality and you click log it then itemizes each ingredient under the meal. an improvement of that functionality can be that each scan gets group and then there’s a subgrouping showing each ingredient that can be modified. example chicken soup, subgroup: chicken, broth, celery, potatoes, noodles. 

what happened is if you do 2 or more scan under a single meal it all lumps together and makes it harder to go back and figure out what needs updating for that ingredient."

update after reply from developer: thank you for your response and your vision on what an advertisement is and is not. i would consider the pop ups i receive that encourage the purchase of the subscription tier an advertisement. but i concur that there are not random or target ad pop ups that are unrelated or related to the app other than the ones that promote the subscription tier. thanks!"
13000170443,2025-08-10 12:43:59-07:00,thefoxhasopinions,4,best tracker out there,i love this app but it needs to have a way to track pushes instead of steps for those of us who use a wheelchair to get around. add that and i will happily give it the 5th star 😊
12998379059,2025-08-10 03:15:12-07:00,sarah sally,3,frustrated with exercise feature,"the app would benefit from a programming change for exercise from the apple watch. in order for exercise minutes to be recorded the user must always log the exercise. for example, yesterday i logged 17,000 steps doing 8 hrs of yard work and the apple watch recorded about 40 minutes of exercise because it detected my heart rate was up. because i didn’t log in a workout, the coach for this app advised me to get more exercise to meet my goals. the algorithm also flagged an inconsistency when i had previously recorded that i exercise every day, asking me to again take the survey. the app needs another round of beta testing with people really using the app. i’m frustrated with the features and that it’s advertised in ways it doesn’t deliver."

the app is easy to use in tracking your nutrients. the ai feature is ok. 

the problem with the app is that it continual decreases your calories if you aren’t losing weight fast enough. it had me under 1,000 calories a day putting my body in starvation mode making it hard to keep losing weight. i have not figured out a way to prevent that from happening."

not all nutrient values are available under the free version but the main ones are, including (to my surprise) the use of the built in bar code scanner. 

i’ve been using this app every day for about 2 months now. 

and, as soon as i’m done with a workout (indoor cycling on my schwinn ic4) and i burned let’s say, 500 calories. 
the mynetdiary app, picks all of this info up. 

my setup is linked mynetdiary to apple health to strava to zwift to my ic4 and after the bike uploads the information, mynetdiary grabs it and immediately calculates those 500 calories i just burned, adding them into my 1880 calorie budget i have set, within the app. 

i like using this app so much that i decided to just go on pay their $59.99 yearly subscription, which comes to about $5/month. 
so far it’s been well worth it to me. i really love using mynetdiary."

12937520461,2025-07-25 23:05:54-07:00,jacked_maki,4,the perfect and free tracker for all your needs,"after seeing an ad for macro factor, probably the most used tracking app currently and seeing that it requires a subscription fee, i just had to write a review to defend and support my biggest help in every day life for the last 2 years, mynetdiary. 

mynetdiary is able to help you count calories, gain weight, lose weight, keep track of everything you eat by scanning the barcode of your food or looking it up, and in 9/10 cases, what you're looking for is part of their system and there is accurate information on it. 

mynetdiary can give you an accurate calorie count for your goals simply based on the info you put in. you log your weight, set a goal weight, and choose the weekly rate to gain or lose weight and it does the math for you, giving you your daily calorie limit and as you continue to log your changing weight, it will automatically update your calories to continue furthering your progress. 

mynetdiary doesn't track steps and doesnt have a gps system like pacer does, which is a great app to use along side this one for tracking everything that you need to. 
the app does however have a section on the dashboard for logging steps, logging exercise (this is where it accounts for calories burned) and even allows you to track your water consumption which can help remind you to stay hydrated. 

i was told about mynetdiary by a friend in june 2023 and since then have gained 45 lbs and at least half of that was muscle (i was a novice at the time, so it wasnt newbie gains). 
mynetdiary has helped me with all of my goals and has allowed me to become a completely different person physically, all without paying for a subscription! 

i hope that the developers of mynetdiary continue to keep it's basic options and functions free for people like me and take pride in the versatility of their work and the integrity of their support through making this app."

the ai meal recognition is decent, but it struggles (understandably) to figure out portions. that results in numbers that are not always where they should be. 

tracking could be more user friendly. i’ve used this app for a month now and even being computer savvy the interface isn’t always optimal (recipes, cough cough or not being able to choose ai once you click your meal type).

bottom line - there are better tracking apps out there."

i am down a total of 26 lbs since march which i have noticed amazing changes and improvements in all aspects of my life. here’s the best part of that 26 lb loss, i used mynetdiary for two weeks prior to beginning willow and can attribute 50% of the weight lost to using the app alone. 
bottom line is, after i have achieved my target weight, i may stop using willow glp-1 but i will never stop using mynetdiary as my companion for all healthy life choices when it comes to food, drink and dessert."

used. and calories earned thru exercise. it allows me to forecast what foods i can eat at other meals.

the new ai photo feature is scary awesome. (part of the upgrade plan) where you can take a picture of your food and it will identify every item on your plate even down to the pepper flakes and sauces. it’s pretty darn accurate! it’s saves time and makes it fun.

portion size has a lot to do with it, but what i eat is another half of the equation.  by using the bar code scanner, i didn’t even have to describe what i was eating.  i did have an inexpensive scale from my crafting work; i now leave it on the kitchen counter to accurately measure nuts, meat, whatever.  

i especially appreciate the breakdown of my meals for the day into their nutritional components.  i can see how much protein i need to eat for the day, or i can show my dr my sodium intake over the last few weeks. so much useful information comes out of this app!

my net diary also logs exercise in the same place, making the incorporation of walking, biking, or whatever easy peasy.  how that affects weight loss is apparent in this app. did i mention that this app also tracks your weight loss?

so far your app seems more complete than lose it, and i like the ai feature for photographing a meal to get an estimate of its calories. however, it does need some tweaking.  for breakfast this morning i had a bowl of cereal with blackberries on the top.  it correctly identified the component and came up with a calorie estimate for “miniwheats, blackberries and milk” which seemed fairly accurate.  however, it then proceeded to add each ingredient in again separately, thus doubling the total.  i was able easily to delete the duplication, so no harm no foul.

as they say in congress, i’ll revise and extend my remarks after i have more experience with this app.  maybe one i reach my 165 goal, which is scheduled for the first week of august."

it is wonderful!  i was using another popular app, but it was not meeting my needs to track and manage the diabetic side of my diet. mnd does everything the other app did and way more! 

with my cgm and this app i am provided great feedback - i am able to track and record how my body responds to foods . it is easy to learn and individualize -very intuitive! i was able to enter the dietary guidelines my healthcare providers gave me . the dashboard provides an instant visual of where i am at anytime during the day and helps me make good choices. i use ios devices snd have it on both my ipad and phone-i can easily switch2 from one to another and it stays concurrent. 

i have been using it for nearly a month now- i have lost almost 5lbs and have some really good data for my next dr visit that might help with medication adjustments. there are charts and reports that i can generate &print out to show them. 

i started with the basic, tried the free trial for the premium - and it knocked my socks off- so i did what i rarely do with apps—i upgraded from free to premium version . 

customer support - is great !  here’s how i know: note : there is a basic and a diabetic in the app store - i had both at one point - but upgrading to premium includes the diabetic - customer support helped me get it straightened out - dmetri responded very quickly with clear, easy detailed instructions ! 
very happy with this app and highly recommend. it is functional and affordable which is important since i am on a fixed income. and easy to use (i am nearly 70 and have no problem with figuring it out ! )"

12608923528,2025-05-01 18:33:01-07:00,shockbaudelaire,2,the app is overwhelmingly complicated to navigate,"let’s start with the positives: it’s pretty easy to scan labels and input the food you’re eating for a very accurate calorie breakdown. it’s even pretty good on keeping you on track with your weight goals. that’s where my praises stop, because while this accomplishes its goal it doesn’t do it well.
the app itself is frustrating to navigate, i’m using the free version so that may change the experience but key data like carbs, fats, and protein seem to be buried deep down for no good reason. that info should be just as prominent as the “calorie apple” counter. the ux/ui just seems outdated and cobbled together. there’s always way too much needless information on the screen at once. if the developers would just take a moment to modernize their app, simplify the experience and not lock so many features behind a pay wall then maybe i would give it a longer shot. but i’m pretty fed up."

i wear a pedometer watch that counts my steps because i don’t take my phone everywhere. my watch doesn’t work with this app. 
i am really disappointed that i cannot simply add in my steps manually and the app saves it. 
instead .. i add my steps and then it does not save my steps and instead erases them. 
i have reached out several times to support asking them for help or to do the simple adjustment of saving my steps manually… i’ve never heard back from support. 
so .. there is no support. 
if your watch or phone doesn’t work with app. i would find a different app.
