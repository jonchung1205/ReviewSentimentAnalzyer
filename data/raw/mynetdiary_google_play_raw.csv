The database of foods is vast, and includes items found only in my local grocery store. If you do need to document something not in the database, it's very easy to add it manually. I like that, as I lose weight and document in the app, it will periodically recalculate and display my recommended max calorie intake per day to continue with my weight loss. Glad I found this app!",1,9.3.1,,

To set a minimum calorie goal, go to My Weight Goal & Plan > Weight & Calories > Food Calorie Budget, then set your Minimum Calorie Budget. The max for weight loss = your Weight Maintenance Calories.

Now it's just a pull down that only updates AFTER the day is over so you're manually having to work out where you're at for the week. They decided the week only runs Monday to Sunday mine isn't like that.Can't do calorie cycling to your own settings now you have to stick to their percentages.Every time u log weight big message in daily total says ""review plan"" it changes plan when u dont want to.Not renewing!",2,9.3.1,"Hi Steve, thanks for your detailed feedback — we're sorry for the frustration.
