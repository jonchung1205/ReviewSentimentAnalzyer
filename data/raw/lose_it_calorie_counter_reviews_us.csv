plus i refuse to subscribe to any app that takes me out of apple to pay. if you don’t except payments directly from the app store then you won’t get my money. simply do not trust anyone that does that."

if it had a simple way to do the above three tasks i wanted i'd give it 5 stars - as it is it feels like buying a (say) hummer to drive 5 miles to church and shopping every day."

also, other apps are able to use the picture you take of your food and identify what is in the food and calculate portion sizes. they can even come up other ethnic foods and their names and even restaurants brands. this one has rarely gotten the food right so far. it couldn’t even figure out the applebees southwest chicken bowl. i had to type it in. it’s also not as user friendly as other ones i’ve used."

also, i love how i’m able to easily add items that i’ve already eaten.

i’ve tried all the calorie counting apps and this one is the simplest along with the best dashboard.

when adding any water, even just “tap water” or a can of any flavored water or bottle, etc. -  and specify the amount (eg 12oz), it does not get added to apple health for your water intake, which i rely on for other apps to use.
so i have to add all water intake manually, and then add it to lose it also to keep things in sync… not a very good solution.

i know it would be possible for you to add this, and i am really asking that you do.

i actually mainly use this app due to having diabetes and needing to track:
- water
- nutrition data (more types supported would be great, but even now is nice!)
- etc.

and, it already supports caffeine strangely, and not water. but i can scan a can of soda – and as long as it has caffeine in the nutrition info, it will sync that to my apple health caffeine intake.

i’ve used to this app to track things for close to a decade probably. and, this would be my first feature request – and i assume a lot of other people would benefit from it as well.

for the month. the basic version felt like a lot of work, in terms of getting all of my favorite foods into the history. with premium, i was able to take pictures and accurately add items quickly. this really comes in handy when you have a dish with lots of ingredients, like a salad or pasta dish. it also captures the quantity of each ingredient. i also like how you can customize macros in addition to the different eating plans like (heart healthy, low fat, etc).

my biggest complaint is that i like that the appl keeps track of my activity (through the phone or watch), but it automatically gives you extra calories to eat when your activity is higher. there should be a way to turn the bonus calories off, while still capturing the activity. i’m not working out to eat those calories back."

one of the biggest wins for me is that when you go premium you do not get bombarded with spammy ads like with some competitors. everything just works smoothly. the app makes it easy to clearly see where i need improvement and i love being able to track if i have had a good week. if i stay on point with my calories i can even treat myself to something sweet in moderation without feeling guilty.

the recipe feature is my favorite. i can add my own recipes and the app picks everything up automatically. there is no need to enter every single ingredient one by one and i find this gives me much better accuracy. i have also used the snap it feature when i am out which gives me a quick estimate of what i am eating on the go.

the results speak for themselves. i had already lost 50 lbs but then i was stuck for about six weeks. with the help of lose it and some adjustments to my workout routine i was able to break through and lose another 26 lbs.

overall lose it has been a game changer for me. it is user friendly accurate and makes tracking food so much easier. i highly recommend it to anyone serious about their health goals."

you know an app is in a death spiral when an “update” strips a key feature from the free version and changes it to premium only. ironically, or perhaps fittingly, the subscription sheet that appears in ios 17.6.1 is non-functional due to a nsurlerrordomain error. so you can’t pay them even if you wanted to give in to their extortion. whoops!

then a couple days ago, i once again went into the app. i did not have premium so once again tried to purchase premium. lots of error on the screen and no it did not add it. a couple days later i looked at my credit card on line and yes they charged me but still no access. i filed a complaint and am still waiting to hear back.

2. create a section for “my pantry” for things i use regularly (ex my kind of mayo, cheese, etc.). i know it’ll save in “my foods” for some time, but that also saves anything i’ve used recently, even if it’s not something i regularly use. would love to put in all the items i regularly use so they’re easy to find.
3. lastly, this is just personal preference, but would love if you could collab with the deglaze app! i use lose it! for calories and tracking, and deglaze to hold all my recipes and make easy shopping lists. i have to type in my macros to the deglaze app to have it all in one place. it’d be sweet if you collaborated with them to sync across platforms!"

june 2021 update: the loseit widget is no longer working on iphones. the widget says that it cannot load the information. i’ve removed and reinstalled the widget a few times to see if this would fix it, but it doesn’t. please address this issue!

october 2020 update: it seems that the screens to join a challenge are not working properly. sometimes the buttons on the screen work and sometimes they don’t. i am unable to join a challenge for the month of october because of this reason. specifically, the join button doesn’t respond. other buttons to go view other challenges also don’t work. november 2017 update: the developers still have not addressed the concern where user-added food items are often incorrect and inaccurate. i wish there was a way that i could screen out those entries in the app. i don’t want to see the food items that other users have entered because i don’t trust their information or accuracy! to be quite honest, i wish they would take away the option for users to share their food entries with the entire community altogether. so much wrong information is being crammed into the food nutritional database that way.

 august 2016 update: the app has improved since my last review in 2015. i'm glad the developers addressed all those issues that many others also complained about. one thing i wish they would do to improve the app would be to make an option to not see the foods that were added to the database by other users. over time, the database is getting more and more crowded with inaccurate and incorrect entries from other users. because of this reason, i do not want to see the entries made by other users and wish there was a way to screen them out. the most recent update in april 2015 is terrible! it removes the ability to add custom foods. i guess maybe they want you to use the built-in scanner and start scanning barcodes create new food items in your log. i don't like that. invasion of privacy. half the time the bar codes have incorrect information anyway regarding nutrients, calories, fat content, etc. i have learned the hard way not to automatically download and install an app update. before downloading the recent massive loseit! update, i came on here to read the reviews about it. that's when i discovered the latest update ruined the app. so...i didn't bother downloading the update to my iphone and, instead, will wait until an update is released that gets good reviews from other users. so glad my loseit! app still measures food in cups, ounces, tablespoons, etc. and not in grams!"

for reference, i am trying to lose fat and build muscle at the same time. this is tricky, so i need to be very specific about my macros. i have also never been a light person, so losing weight is incredibly important to me and has been very tricky.

the issues i have with loseit are the following:

1. the dashboard does not incorporate planned foods into the individual macros. it does show the planned food percentage in the “macronutrients” section, but under fiber and protein, it does not.
2. the verbiage. i’m used to using the fitbit app for tracking food, so when i switched to garmin, i also started using loseit. the problem is that the app frames the calories you are under as calories “available” to consume, instead of calories out (which is what fitbit does). if you are eating on a deficit, this is the wrong term to use. in one widget, it does refer to the calories as “under,” so i wish that would be consistent across the entire app. if you eat the calories “available” to you, you will be eating maintenance and losing no weight.

i have tried myfitnesspal and stopped using it when they locked barcode scanning behind a paywall. i may switch to macrofactor or something if the app stays in its current state.

all in all, this app is not for those who don’t have a good relationship with food or may have other things going on that make it hard to lose weight. this is for people who find losing weight to be on the easier side and just need to track their caloric intake."

12793881024,2025-06-19 13:02:30-07:00,bodhi gato,4,needs beverage log,"i love this app. i’m on mounjaro and need to track protein really closely, and it does that and tracks many other facets of diet as well.

the one big thing it is missing is a beverage log, so if you have a g & t or a glass of wine or a chai latte, you don’t have to log it under “snacks”

surely you developers don’t think all we drink is water. add that daily beverage log!"
12793533458,2025-06-19 11:02:16-07:00,gullum45,1,4+,"on the app store, it says 4+ but whenever you try to sign in, you have to be at least 18 why don’t they just put 18+ or 17+"

12790091945,2025-06-18 13:15:07-07:00,pingpapi,4,great app so far!,"loving the app so far! easy to navigate and the scanner is the way to go to input your calories. used ai tool once and i was impressed, probably most useful when going out to eat. only thing i wish they added was the option to track calories to for weight/muscle gain. the app doesn’t recognize my goals and thinks i’m doing too much. got myself the lifetime subscription since it’s a great deal!"
12788631852,2025-06-18 05:47:58-07:00,themichiganmaddog,5,themichiganmaddog,i’ve had this app for quite a few years now when it comes down to is your discipline to put the information in and stick to it. it has helped me over the years to keep track of what i have eaten and help me understand why i gained weight or why i lose weight based on the type and quantity of the food i eat. this is a great app. i would definitely recommend it. 10rats.com
12788254860,2025-06-18 03:39:38-07:00,smegaltoo,5,number 1 app !,"i was told about this by a weight loss doctor many years ago.  it is the only app i use because it is easy so easy to use.
the database of food is huge .  the barcode scanner is self-explanatory.  if for some reason, my food is not listed, it allows me to quickly create the item and add to my database.  believe me, i have tried others over the years, but this app is the only one i use.  kudos and great job and for keeping it simple.   they are even good about support issues. one time i had to ask a technical question. i received my response in less than 24 hours 5plus stars"
12786246813,2025-06-17 13:32:29-07:00,drb2851,3,complicated,i like the concept but it’s not very intuitive and it takes forever to put the meals in because there’s no icon that corresponds. it’s too time consuming to log everything.
12784733605,2025-06-17 05:32:29-07:00,bargainal,4,easy to use & helpful in losing weight!,because using lose it is easy to use and has great benefits and reminders this app has helped me track and lose 108lbs!
12784252984,2025-06-17 02:30:37-07:00,informationmaven,5,barcode scan is great,"i recently traveled internationally to several countries where i didn’t know the language, and the barcode scanner worked on every item i scanned. i was thrilled that this feature was still available to help me stay on track."
12783150823,2025-06-16 18:13:24-07:00,logan madison dean,5,the best app,i like it because i can take a picture of my food and check the calories and get it it awesome
12782867820,2025-06-16 16:16:28-07:00,angeldemonboy,3,more positive?,"please be more positive when you go over your calorie budget. it makes me feel bad about going over and it could really affect other people in a negative way. i’d like some positive reinforcement when you do go under or meet it instead of making me feel bad. good app, helps me with dieting. also, some food nutrition facts can be wayyy off and make me go way over when i know the nutrition facts. i hate having to put it all on manually"
12782486043,2025-06-16 13:47:09-07:00,tay.s--93,1,terrible update,i used to love this app. they have now put the barcode scanner behind a paywall. although it doesn’t make the app useless it makes it pretty inconvenient for quick tracking.
12781380551,2025-06-16 07:52:40-07:00,gmabec,3,"great app, but….","i love this app, easy to use, really enjoy having the ability to speak scan or snap a photo. one feature i wish they would have is, if i had logged food in error into snacks,  it would be great to be able to tap a button and change the entries to lunch or dinner….instead of reentering and deleting the entire meal, also you should be able to delete individual items, instead of having to delete the entire meal :/ i did the 7 day trial, and paid $40 for the year, but i’ll definitely research other apps rather than sign up for lifetime….if these features are addressed i would consider the lifetime subscription."
12778919913,2025-06-15 15:10:51-07:00,sofidagaot,1,too young,it’s says you can be 4 plus in order to use the app but in reality you need to be 18. false information.
12778880714,2025-06-15 14:55:18-07:00,venus1173,2,horrible update,please remove the add a meal pop up. it’s not necessary. if i’m trying to create a recipe i don’t need to put what meal it is
12777879132,2025-06-15 09:21:58-07:00,mr. emery,5,great to track meals!,the app has been great
12775867411,2025-06-14 21:21:06-07:00,covertyankee,4,missing a few things.,i have used the app religiously for the past two weeks. i really like that you can scan foods into the tracker. i would have given the app 5 stars but it is missing things i’d like to track such as vitamin d and other vitamins. i would also like a breakdown for carbs like the “other” calorie counting app does. lose it! is a good value for the price and i have lost weight using it. just a few tweaks and it would be perfect.
12774864721,2025-06-14 14:34:41-07:00,halbbb,1,bugged,i’m paying for the subscription to use the barcode scanner and i can’t even use it
12773511962,2025-06-14 07:11:23-07:00,sister.ray,1,the annoying questions just to get started,"update:  i totally forgot about how this app works and thought i’d try it again.  never made it past the questions.  lol.  i just want to set my own goal and start logging food and exercise.  super simple, but they don’t allow it.  i already know my goal and what i’m doing. and your suggestions are far off.

old review:  i can’t get past the million annoying questions just to start tracking calories and exercise. there was no way to skip it. update… tried again. got through all of the annoying questions. then it doesn’t let you customize anything.  you must do their suggested plan/calorie goals. deleted the app again. wasted my time."
12773449597,2025-06-14 06:53:39-07:00,gtiphone,1,difficult,very difficult to cancel. app doesn’t work well taking pictures of food. cumbersome ui. expensive. waste of $ and kind  of a trap.
12773266191,2025-06-14 05:59:17-07:00,rlt*679,5,great,great app very easy to use.
12771656175,2025-06-13 19:15:11-07:00,saraalinia,4,could use some improvements,i used to use this app often and have many saved recipes so i still use it every time i want to know the nutrition values of a recipe. my biggest complaint is that if i don’t use the app for some time and open it i have to go through the entire questionnaire and it’s very frustrating. i was hoping that selecting the “use my old plan” option would exempt me from going through every single question but nope! i ask the developers to please rethink this!
12771474550,2025-06-13 18:02:08-07:00,don eva,5,great for tracking calories!,love that you can just scan any bar code and it will add it for you! great!10/10

12769044055,2025-06-13 04:02:02-07:00,kosugii,5,keeps you accountable,really helps with accountability and pushes you to stay on track. also increases you knowledge on just how many calories common foods contain.
12768061386,2025-06-12 20:36:02-07:00,lanu1993,4,excellent app but needs ui revamp,"i love all the features in this app but my only qualms with it is how convoluted it feels. i wish there was a simpler, less cluttered way to view info and options for changing the app icon."
12767898868,2025-06-12 19:24:09-07:00,senercha_cha,5,love this app,"i hardly ever write reviews! i was recently put in a situation where i needed to get serious about my health. at 40+ years old the weight was just not coming off. i have tried several programs and successfully lost weigh in my former years, but as soon as i stopped paying, i stopped paying attention and the weight crept back on and brought friends with it. i like this app because it tailor makes a program for you and gives you ample time to learn how to use it, find features that are helpful for you, create recipes, and practice tracking. it automatically syncs with my apple watch and gives me work out bonuses as well. this app allows me to eat how i want to eat. if i have a day where i want a fat cookie i find a way to work it into my allowed calorie budget. there are no points, or tricks to make you continue to pay… $40 a year which is significantly less than the competition and allows for a sustainable way to eat real food that i like, in a way that is melting the pounds off."
12766678702,2025-06-12 11:21:38-07:00,nikki1947384,2,inaccurate,"it definitely convenient where you don’t have to type in the nutrition details for everything you eat but even the verified foods, the nutrition is inaccurate. i had something that i even scanned the label and the nutrition said 29g of sat fat, it was really 2… now i question everything i scan and go back and check in anyway so doesn’t save time"
