A little less “buy premium” popping up every time you “touch a crown” 😂 would be nice but the app is free after all. 

A setting option for a 24 hour clock instead of AM/PM would be terrific, all in all it is an easy to use friendly formatted app."

13172386208,2025-09-22 18:28:30-07:00,Zaronology,2,"When the macros are wrong, which is very, very, very, very often","When the macros are wrong on a food, you have to input the entire thing all on its own. That wouldn’t be such a pain, as other apps do it, but those other apps typically let you copy the same information over and just adjust what you need for your own records. with this one, you have to submit the information with a picture, which is just absolutely ridiculous. It is so inconvenient and waste so much of your time to use this app. The more basic apps will suit you much better if you’re actually doing this on a daily basis. I thought that this app would give me more reports and things that would benefit me, I was wrong. 

The user experience on this app is very clunky, time consuming, and not intuitive. I honestly don’t understand how this app has such good ratings, unless it’s audience has never used a different type of app. None of them are perfect, but where they are not perfect they make it easy for you to make adjustments on your own without having to wait days for them to update the food for you to get an idea of what you’re really consuming. Other people may not take their diet as I do perhaps, but since I’m putting in the effort to do it anyway I wanna know down to the proper calorie, not have to make estimates or waste time having to do manual inputs because their data is an accurate."

UPDATE 2025-08
App is working again. It seems the VPN built into my iPhone is causing the issue. I’m not sure how to feel about an app knowing it only works when the VPN is disabled.

Also some of the nutrition scoring is frustrating. Most nutrition coaches would say a less sugar fairlife protein drink is better than a premier protein but fairlife is a D or C+ while premier was a B. There were other confusing score values as well. I tried to submit feedback in the app but the app is also didn’t let me complete that process and just said I needed to set an email? Which I had already in my account?

However, when it comes to adding the missing nutritional information from so many various food items that are missing from your database, it is extremely frustrating that you ask to send the photo of the nutritional labels via e-mail to be addressed at a later time by someone else, who does that these days. It should be addressed immediately via A.I. tools being implemented right within the app so that it can immediately extract all necessary nutritional information right from the user’s photo of the nutrition label, instantaneously reflected in real-time basis. Please get with the trend and keep your app capable; otherwise, new contenders will literally turn your app completely irrelevant, then no one will use it, period."

To make sure I am connected to WiFi or cellular service. It is, but the problem is that I ALWAYS use a VPN. They hate that because it makes it a lot harder for them to track us and spy on us. Many unscrupulous companies (I don’t know about this one) claim that they don’t allow VPN’s because of security concerns. What a load of you know what. VPN’s increase your online security by encrypting your online traffic. And that is why they keep telling people to use a VPN while using a public and unsecured internet connection. Such as the WiFi connections at markets, stores, coffee houses, airports and bus terminals, and so on. But it also interferes with companies ability tracking you and your device. No tracking, no selling of your personal information and that means less money for the greedy developers."

The app is so simple. The automatic calculation of how many calories I can eat in real time is great!  As soon as I exercise and the effort is recorded by my smart watch to my health app and read by Fooducate, I know how many calories I have “earned”, no calculations or point counting needed. Similarly, as soon as I weigh myself and the weight is recorded by my smart scale to my health app and read by Fooducate, my daily target calories are automatically adjusted.

This time I used Apple to create an account to avoid giving them personal information. FYI, the app is not nearly as useful as the website. I could not find anywhere to search for foods. Just stick to using the website.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Like the website, hate the app

I downloaded this app because I like the website. But the app immediately began prompting me for personal information. Height, weight, age, etc. I did not fill in any of the information. 

I clicked on the word “skip.“ Even though I clicked on “skip,” it still filled in personal information for me that it obtained somewhere ***without my permission.*** The information was accurate and appeared to be coming from the Apple Health app even though I had ***not granted this app access to the Health app.***

I then discovered I was forced to create an account just to view nutritional information on foods. I decided to immediately stop using the app. I guess the developers felt like although they had a good thing going with their website, why not use their app to collect as much personal data as possible, even for people who have no intention of using the app to track calories."

I then sent a support ticket & they told me they weren’t going to do anything until enough others are sending in support tickets for it even while the community discussion page has MANY people complaining about the same issue.

Let’s not forget, their search function is…… antiquated to be nice. Like the functionality of it hasn’t been updated in years."

It has a wide range of food already loaded and has useful features like upc scanning.

I wish the grade system was more like a traffic light so I wouldn’t feel like a failure when my food is a D or F.  Side note: why is diet soda so frequently a D?  It’s been a huge game changer for not drinking all my calories.  It would be helpful for them to encourage a moderation with low grade foods rather than declare chocolate as a whole bad.

However, as of late this app has been unreliable. During most meal times, the app is unusable due to high server usage. When trying to make recipes, as you search for individual ingredients, you have to sift through dog and cat foods that clog up the entire first 100~ search results. I have seen users online complain about this, but the devs seems to not care enough to do anything about it. Usually your only option is to either A) keep scrolling until you find the item or have to add it your own or B) choose extremely unreliable and inconsistent “user added” items that have inaccurate nutrition reporting. That leads me to my last point: the clunkiness. From the server issues, to the inconvenience of having to add manually every item, to random bugs, this app has finally pushed me away from using it anymore. If you want a more seamless experience for tracking macros and the like, find another app. And especially, DO NOT PAY FOR THIS. You will regret spending your money on such a hollow app. If you only casually keep track of things, this app may be for you. However, I feel I cannot use this anymore."

I also don’t like that they don’t define the activity levels which makes it hard to gauge how their programming factors each activity level in.

Feels like its meant for a food scientist. Also, the ads are annoying and run across the tol and bottom of the app. While trying to enter information I often accidentally clicked an ad that I did not want to view.  The only good thing about this app is that it got me in the mental habit of tracking my meals and now I have the confidence to track on my own without the drama of mavigating this poorly designed user experience.

The Community tab was updated in the most recent version and the quality of he photos is 1000% better! They also made the side menu easier to navigate. The draw back is you still can’t access the “My Meals” options from the “My Lists” tab. It is only History and Likes. Your recipes can’t be viewed there either. You have to go to the recipes tab. 
There desktop version of the app has zero features. When you’re inputting a full recipe it is easier on desktop.

you can add you're own stuff, recipes, etc. so no more putting in each individual ingredient like some other apps end up making you do! it allows you to track a lot of different things, too. sure, you need to pay for some of it, but the free version is great on its own i'm ngl - that's all i've been using thus far.

it's helped me reach my calorie goals AND it doesn't shake you for eating certain foods. the food score it gives is just a ratio of the calorie quality, aka if you're getting enough calories that will actually do something for your body. other apps just decide it has added sugar so it's a D rating and it ruins your score for the day which i feel adds to unhealthy views of things like sugar, fats, etc.

1) The database has not improved over the years. It is missing many good items and the only way to enter them into the database is to take a photo and email the photo to Fooducate. Therefore, the missing foods are never entered into the database because that would require human staff entering in the details.

Food I took photos of and have submitted several times over quite a few years have yet to be added to the database and I doubt that they ever will be.

2) Features like the Community forums were originally free and part of the app. However, the developers prioritized monetization (I believe the app was sold and the new owners have pushed the monetization-before-features drive) so Community disappeared behind a paywall.

3) So many ads have been added to the app that it’s impossible, on iOS, to listen to music, podcast, or have any media continue playing; the ads make sure iOS constantly pauses media. Quite disruptive.

4) For the several years I’ve been using the app, I am always confronted with an ad for a discount on the app and the DISCOUNT ENDS TODAY!!!!!!! It has been the case for several years. There is no discount. There’s the same price it is always offered at and there is no time deadline. That’s called a dark pattern.

Like I said, I do like the app, the concept behind it is great, but the prioritization of monetization over form or function is not a good luck and takes a lot of value away from the app."

So then I tried the other passwords I previously attempted and nothing but error messages. Then I have to request a password change. So, it takes me to the URL and yet again declines any password formation I attempt. Too bad. I was looking forward to this app but I guess I have to use my fitness pal instead.

I’m a “Clean” , Fresh food eater, GF, nitrate ,soy and red meat free for decades and enjoyed seeing my average A- rating daily. I eat a ton of food daily , never hungry,and even got through a Birthday, Thanksgiving and Christmas with flying colors. Bought an Air fryer to enjoy healthy fresh air fried veg. And the clock they added recently helps so if you don’t have time to record immediately, you can list all later .Now it’s great. Now I’m just trying to NOT lose more weight. If you’re a tad OCD , this will work, if you cheat… you’re only cheating yourself. This makes you aware of the quality and calorie(or carb). Lose the junk, sugar and fats.

Few years ago: few updates and all and they added the option for tracking food… which is nice for those who wanted a one stop shop app. Still able to use the scan product to see how healthy, but a little less informative as before…

2/2024: we have almost fully moved from the whole “educate” portion of the app of food people ate to view a full “educate “ you have to purchase a subscription… now main focus is tracking and bare minimum on education of the food. This may lead to me finally getting rid of the app. Because the more it changed the less I use the app."

As someone who’s trying to limit calories and right-size my nutritional mix, the app just didn’t give me the info I needed while considering my order at non-fast food restaurants.

I also noticed there’s TONS of different podcasts to help you with your journey be it weight management, mental health, diet programs, fitness and working out, music, self help type stuff, motivational topics and advice kinda topics. I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, PTSD and they have main show podcast episodes on all of those topics. Really neat stuff they have to offer. I don’t know what it’s gonna look like once the 3 day trial ends but we shall see.

The new app grabs an immense amount of personal info: age, gender, height, weight, location and more. It takes a long time to set up. Then it informs you that it will track your activities, and not just online.

If you bother to read their privacy policy, you’ll find that they share your info with 30(!) entities around the globe. You have to hunt to disable this, and then wonder whether it will honor your choice.

Then comes more trickery – you have to pay a significant amount: $46 a year or you can buy it permanently for $113 (I may be off a bit on this bc I deleted the app). There’s a three-day trial, but after that they automatically bill you for a year.

I reached out and Fooducate said they could not replicate the error on their end and they closed my case saying they are “aware of the issue with not only me but other users as well.” And that was it!

Awesome!) They also have a lot of trendy, with-love features like diet ""preferences"" to help you stay on track (keto, low carb, heart healthy, kidney healthy, etc etc. theres a lot of options!!)

That being said, though, The problem is they are WAY too feature thin for freemium to work.

I get it man, everyone needs to make money. But im not gonna pay for a food tracker, ever, and thats a vast majority of your target market audience. If you add basic features to the free tier, however, your overwhelmingly better app and more charming product/branding will draw everyone from my fitness pal. Namely, all i need functionality wise is the ability to select how much protein i want to eat daily and the ability to see a breakdown of ALL of my macros and micros once i put them in manually. Thats seriously it. 

You can lock a lot of other stuff behind premium, like exporting data sets, camera scan for food, removing ads, etc and premium users will still get bang for your buck. I think the community tab would benefit from more users, but maybe thats an opinion too, so whether thats free or premium is probably still a debate.

My point in writing this review is to hope you guys see it and understand you really are tripping over your own shoe laces at the end of a marathon. I love this app, i would use this app over other apps, but i am a free tier user and this has locked too much of basic functionality behind a paywall and those simple things need to change to get widespread adoption.

Plus, you run ads...like, more users, more ads... and its a bit insulting to get ads and still not have the basic expected level of functionality.

You guys will make your money, dont worry lol. There's still plenty of value in other areas for premium."

So, after a Google search of which apps do allow for tracking of added sugar and vitamins and minerals I downloaded this one. 

Negatives: 
(1) It grades foods (A, B, C, D) and I couldn’t find any rubric or information for what the food means, if you enter your own food it asks you to assign it a letter, it doesn’t do it for you If you add your own food. I wish it was a number scale and then you could just use the OptUp number.
(2) It is nearly impossible to paste the ingredients on an iPhone because of where the placement of the field box is on the screen.
(3) If you add your own food, you cannot edit it if you want to add more information or correct a mistake, you have to make a duplicate entry and you cannot delete the other incorrect or incomplete one from your “my foods”.
(4) One hundred percent of the foods I looked up were incorrect but usually mostly correct, but there is no way to select one of them or copy it and just fix it, you have to make a new food from scratch.
(5) There is a button to report incorrect information but not say what is incorrect, it prompts you to take a photo of the nutritional facts but won’t let you go to an already existing photo like a screenshot from the company’s page.
(6) The dealbreaker for me; you cannot edit your own goals of calories, protein grams, etc. 
(7) It does not allow you to track vitamin b12, the only vitamins are A and D The vitamins and iron and whatnot are only able to be tracked as “%” which is different for literally everyone, as someone pregnant/breastfeeding this is really dumb to me and I don’t want to do a backwards conversion to get it into the information I need it in.
(8) None of the foods I looked at had suggestions for alternatives but it looked like a cool feature if it did work, Kroger used to have an app like that called OptUp. 
(9) It took me an hour to add breakfast and half of lunch and I gave up.
(10) Free version would not be worth anyone’s time 
Positives: 
(1) The ability to track added sugar.
(2) Widgets
(3) There was nothing abnormal about canceling the free trial like other reviews suggest, it’s the same as any other app
(4) The ability to track iron, and in your whole day picture it does show it back as milligrams"

my first issue is there are so many inaccurate items like i tried to log the fact that i had a soda and it said it was 0 calories the soda is actually 150 calories if i wanted to manually do these things myself i would’ve just continued using my notes app. 

second the water tracker is absolute garbage.. i drink out of a stanley cup which is 40 oz but the only unit of measurement is a cup?? what’s a cup like a glass cup or a cup as in unit of measurement and the fact that i cannot customize the unit of measurement is a complete waste bc how can i know exactly how much water i’ve had?? 

third the activity part.. i for the life of me cannot get this to sync to my health/fitness app so it never automatically adds my workout or movement i have to do it and i can’t just log in the exact amount of calories burned bc it goes by unit of time.. 

if anything save your money and just use the notes app to track your progress."

I had two kinds of oat mills side by side and scanned each item. They both had the same ingredients, same fat content, same everything but one was just a different brand. Scanned one oat milk and it got an A, scanned the other oat milk from the different store and it got a C-. Honestly neither of these should have a rating other than a B-. So I’m pretty sure the one brand was paying them to give him a higher score than the other brand because it was literally the exact same product.

Also checked other foods and it was just wildly inaccurate. Some of the most processed bad-for-you foods were rated A or A+ and then the healthy stuff was rated C or D because “too much sugar” even if it was all natural sugar, no added sugar, no fake sugar… just pure organic. Think pineapple. A pineapple getting a bad rating because it has too much natural sugar.

Every now and then I pull out the app just to see if it’s gotten any better. Just now it had me sign in and everything. Put in a bunch of unnecessary personal info about my weight. Once I finally got through it all, I got a notification— FREE TRIAL, then it’s paid??? Some $50?? I didn’t pay attention to it, I laughed and promptly deleted it. This should never be a paid service especially at that price. 

Point being don’t bother with this thing. They’ll tell you bad info and now they’re expecting payment. Use MyFitnessPal or something else— that’s free with a paid option and has much better options and information."

When I do manage to save one of my foods not listed in the database, it doesn’t show up under my foods. It’s possible that it’s just me and the learning curve to the app but it’s frustrating and 3 days just isn’t enough time to figure out if it’s worth the $. I have no problem with paying for an app that will work for me. The developers should be paid for their work. However, I need a little more time working with it to determine if it’s the right one for me AND it shouldn’t show up on my credit card BEFORE the trial is over!

I received a response from the developer regarding the CC issue above, however I’ve gotten many free trial  apps over the years via Apple and have never been charged immediately for a free trial.

The ingredients comprised on the packaging state the exact chips in question actually have buttermilk in the mesquite bbq seasoning..
As such substances are potentially fatal to my consumption, I cannot eat the product that I was told by this app that I actually “could.”

My main qualm is with the sheer inaccuracy of the information used on this app.

Plus calories/ingredients alone do not define the quality and overall ability to be of nutritional value.

  Discernment and caution be at the forefront of your attention always when downloading these “food-education” apps. 
Information can only be as accurate as the sources, and they must’ve not been updated very frequently. 

 Be that as it may, interesting feature but do not recommend relying on this application to determine whether a certain food is consumable for someone with fatal-allergens.

I was overjoyed to discover that this app existed — and links with Apple Health — to give me much needed insight and feedback into my eating habits so I can make some adjustments to my diet. 

This app’s interface is clean and mostly intuitive immediately upon first use this morning, and it’s gotten easier and I’ve discovered further features easily through the day. 

Unfortuantely, it lacks a companion Mac app; working on entering new recipes would be a lot easier on the larger Mac screen rather than being hemmed into the dimensions of my iPhone. I’d also like it see deeper and richer integration with Noom: so far, I have seen that Fooducate will write calorie data into Noom, but it doesn’t provide rich enough information that Noom can rank the food into their green, yellow, and orange categories to help me keep more careful track of my Noom goals. Those two gripes, however, are small compared to the invaluable service I feel it offers me as I’m trying to make the adjustments I’m trying to make.

The latest update has made the app harder to use in the way that I typically use it outside of school and harder for my students to use it during the activity we do in class by putting much more focus on the diet tracker.

At first it’s free… however to get certain functions and options… you pay. I paid for “life/forever” since it only made sense at the time. After using it… and then not using it…. I came back determined to make it work with a new plan. Workout/macro tracking mind you…. Well since I had paid … I tried resetting my password and that apparently is the problem! After two weeks of asking for a password reset… nada. I’ve been asked to, check all my boxes (spam/trash) every day…. NADA. Then was told that since I “unsubscribed “ from the numerous emails… that I now needed to get another email…?!?!?! I asked why and how? I still get emails… “haven’t seen you in awhile…” or “new diet…” I’m sorry, I’m not an IT guru but with technology as it is today, wouldn’t you think the creator of this app would be able to reset a darn account????? 

My fun factor has become disappointed… I did ask for a “let’s meet in the middle” refund. 

My Gen X thinking…. WOW! They still don’t make things like they use to… this applies across the board on anything! 

Note: the app itself if good, not great…. Always room for improvement. You $$ for levels of functionality… so choose wisely and make sure you keep that password written down somewhere!!"

All of these developers lately have been charging that much and more for apps and if I would pay what they want for each app that I need and would like to use I’d have to pay $10,000 a month or more & that makes no sense. I would give this app at 10 star rating, but now, with the greediness of the developers, I’m not even gonna give it a one star & if I could I’d give it a negative.

The food database did not have most foods I wanted to enter—rarely a problem with My Fitness Pal. To track basic nutrients like fiber, you need to buy a subscription. Items are not logged properly (a donut was considered liquid). 

The food ratings are somewhat arbitrary and based on judgments made by the developers. For example, artificial sweeteners will give a food a bad rating because they are “controversial.” There is plenty of evidence that artificial sweeteners are safe, but even if it’s a matter of opinion, why is it included as a “bad” food for everyone? 

Some foods like canned and frozen vegetables also rank worse than their fresh counterparts, despite the fact that frozen often has more nutrients. 

One food I ate was reasonably high in sodium, but it was given a C rating because it contained “25% of daily sodium.” Well, it was my lunch and also 25% of the food I ate that day, so why is this a problem? 

I will go back to My Fitness Pal, which lets me track fiber, sodium, etc individually and without a moral judgment."

8887025965,2022-07-18 09:12:11-07:00,sims226,3,Simple in good and bad ways.,"On the advice of my trainer at the time, I used Fooducate from 2016-2018 and give it credit for helping me understand food, nutrition, and how to properly fuel the body.

In an effort to rebuild my good nutrition habits post pandemic, I once again opted for the Pro subscription to Fooducate in April 2022. The issues started almost immediately.

Despite the persistent 30% discount call-to-action throughout the app, I was charged full pop because I was a prior subscriber. Disappointing, a little bait-and-switchy, but I didn't bother over it much.

Unfortunately, I've had an extremely buggy app experience thereafter. My history would disappear then reappear after a restart. I'd open the app and be treated as a new user, then shut down and log back in to be suddenly remembered. 

Currently I'm logged out of the app and can't login with my Apple ID, and efforts to reset my password have been unsuccessful, apparently due to my admittedly weird "".space"" email domain. Good luck finding support on the main website.

I don't doubt that there are legitimate engineering puzzles behind my troubles, but it all seems like a symptom of the app's mid-2010s UX: mobile-only, wonky authentication, and a fuzzy interface compared to MFP, Lifesum, and Noom, to name a few design and functionality leaders.

Thus my relationship with Fooducate comes to an end. Due credit for being in the right place at the right time for my initial nutritional journey, but the competition circa 2022 is more stable, more modern, and just more pleasant to use."

8884143440,2022-07-17 12:28:53-07:00,kashley knows math,1,Basically just annoying,"First- it only gives you three units of measurement to log things. For example you can log a whole onion (in NLEA serving size, whatever that is) or you can log it by gram or ounce. Not bad even though a bit ridiculous. But then there's things (i.e. Sriracha sauce) that you can log by TBSP g or oz... But what if I consumed 1/8 of TEASPOON? I find myself doing a lot of conversions on the side just to log. 
Second- there is interface kind of stuff that really grind my gears. After you hit ""done"" when logging a food a banner pops up that it was successful and that banner blocks the back button. You have to wait for the banner to go away to go back to the search page to log another food. Not to mention changing one thing on your diet profile (i.e. keto to Mediterranean) it changes EVERYTHING... Your macros being the most annoying. Then there's the part when you click for details on your breakdown and go back it goes back to the top of the page. So if I want to see what foods had the most potassium today (which is at the very bottom of the breakdown) then I click ""back"" it goes right back up to calories. 
I do like the rating system for this. It seems more stringent than others' ratings. However I wish I had not paid for this app as it's too annoying to use."

8834768080,2022-07-02 18:56:55-07:00,OceanState91,4,Great for quality-based eating,"I have bad mindsets around counting calories, like getting obsessed with numbers and binging out. The main focus of Fooducate is to help you eat better. The calorie tracker has the number of calories left for the day, but the “progress wheel” only goes about 3/4 around. So, if I eat a little more or a little less, it doesn’t look like a punishment.

I love the focus on grading different foods. It’s really helped me make more informed  decisions about what I buy. I also like how you can see the grades of the food you’ve eaten on the main page. If I notice I’ve had a lot of processed or low grade foods, it’s a great reminder to balance it out with something healthy. 

My one qualm? Recipes don’t get grades too. I’d love to see the average score based on the ingredients I have in a recipe. The only workaround with this is to add the items and make it a meal. You can’t add meals ahead of time or break them into serving sizes. So if I’m making a big batch of something, I need to manually calculate the portion of each individual ingredient if I want to see the grade. 

My Fitness Pal does something similar already for free, but Fooducate is the overall stronger app in my opinion. Would change this to 5 stars with the addition of this feature."

I like how the app works and the database seems extensive. It’s easy enough to use and I have been tracking food carefully. It has made me make better choices. 
However - I haven’t seen any weight loss this first month. Despite tracking carefully to the ~2k calories that it indicates, and doing daily light exercise (stationary bike) - the pounds will go down 1 day and back up the next. I am scanning and measuring the food out too. Perhaps it’s my age because I have no health conditions. The daily calorie limit does seem to be slowly tapering down in the app now. I assume that’s a feature that will allow me to finally start losing - but the lack of support and info doesn’t make it easy to figure out. I have emailed the support mailbox but the responses are slow to come. Been waiting 3 plus days now for my last question to be answered. It’s only my second email to them. Is there some sort of FAQ that explains how this all works and what to expect?  I looked at the community forum section but it’s not intuitive to me. Lots of food pics is what I see there. Is there a place to post questions and get responses from other users? Still hopeful but a little bit disappointed as well overall."

I will be using this because I did purchase it for a lifetime and I guess it will eventually make sense.
8523852405,2022-04-02 09:17:16-07:00,Userfrom Austin,4,Very underrated,"I think I found this app before The Most Popular fitness tracker gained so much traction, and tbh this app is still superior. The UI is so easy for me to navigate, it’s affordable, and the database of food has grown so much. I also love the long list of different types of exercise, and even though estimating calories burned is not an exact science, I appreciate any ballpark number of extra calories that I need to eat so I don’t hurt myself. Seriously, I tried these other, more talked about apps, and I just don’t want to quit this one. It’s not freaky and aggressive in its wording about sticking to diets and militant exercise and cult-like branded phrasing, and the orange, yellow, and earth tone colors are more pleasant. I also love that it gives you a flexible target date, so you can also set your goal based on the number of calories you want to eat per day. (I like smaller calorie deficits.) Also, bravo for the warnings about going below 1200 calories! Keep being responsible, please!

EDIT: I just deleted a star because I saw below what data they are collecting. Dude, collect my subscription money. Don’t invade my privacy like this. There is no reason to know my contacts, etc. Also, this shouldn’t be an app for ages 4+. Toddlers don’t need to diet. Kids and teens should not be encouraged to diet either given the statistics on the body dysmorphia and eating disorders they develop for life. Thanks!"

I hope someone can tell need there is. I wrote an email to Support and received basic instructions on how to use the app (which was really annoying).

Vegetable oils are highly inflammatory and overall terrible for you. The almonds got a B+. Next I scanned organic, lightly salted cashews with no flavors. They were rated B+.

There’s also a number of things that are for premium members only.

It is quite the handy device as long as the nutritional information is correct and as long as it is not “corrupted” by commercialism. I would hate to think that producers could rate their product higher. But there is no evidence of that so it is fantastic!!

If I had to make one change it would be store specific. For example if I am in a Kroger looking at Kroger brand peanuts then the list that offers a healthier alternative shouldn’t list a Target or Walmart product first. Not saying they shouldn’t be listed just not first. Heck, I am in Kroger why do I care what Target has?

It lets you customize your health conditions on your profile and shows you a breakdown of the nutrients of the food you have eaten that day, but that’s as good as the pro version gets. Although you can customize your health conditions it does not change the recipes that it shows you to cater to those health conditions which is pointless. All of the recipes they show are entered in by the community and they just show the most recent or most popular they do not let you even customize it yourself to show what kind of recipes you want to see based on your diet.

Am I wrong? Is it free? Either way, the eventual price isn’t worth not being able to track more nutrients. On a couple of other apps I’ve tried you can track far more nutrients. The problem is just that their calorie accuracy is not reliable at all.

I’m not a person who is a health nut or goes running everyday, I like food as much as the next person does. But I’m trying to lose weight, and it’s a helpful tool.

It’s also wholesome, seeing a supporting community in the app too for people who want to be healthy, share healthy recipes and lose/maintain their weight. 

I originally was recommended this app by a professor for a health class, and I’ve been using it ever since. 

So, if anything, this app makes it easy to keep track of your calories. It also has other things to offer, like a guide of how many calories you should consume each day, and a database for gradng the quality of a certain type of food. (Which is pretty interesting). 

If you can’t find the food in the database, they have a quick add where you input the calorie amount yourself and it logs it in for you.

Kudos to the developer!"

For example, I’d enjoy a manual calorie burn input for external exercise trackers, instead of being forced to find something similar to what I did, and then trying to make a match with searching through the minutes and hours. Oh, and also being able to define a date as well as a time for exercises and meals would be nice.  Also, the ability to use the “flexible measurement system” where you can manually type in any amount of grams for recipes. The ability to also remove old recipes might be nice.

-can track weight, calories, hunger level, mood, sleep and these are all free features 

Here’s things I don’t like as much:
-wish the water tracker had ounces instead of just cups
-mood tracker could have custom moods you can add
-I dont like that when you add a food it doesn’t automatically track it at the time you added it. It has pre determined meal times (which some could like, but I don’t personally) 
-if you enter a food you can’t change the date of the food 
-wish there was dark mode lol 
-compared to the LoseIt! App, it doesn’t have as many foods in the system

6534357710,2020-10-14 07:12:44-07:00,Kilaeua,3,Excellent,"UPDATE OCTOBER 2020:

Ok, I've used Fooducate for about ten years now. But I stopped about three years ago because there was no option for allowing us to choose our own measurement serving size - such an inconvenience. I switched to Cronometer, an excellent app. 

I've only now use Fooducate for scanning labels in stores to see the grade. That's all it's good for. I've checked each update hoping measurement options would be added. Who measures in cups?  I was happy to see today's update adding sizes. 

We can now measure in..... grams. Grams only.  My kitchen scale measures in ounces so now I have to ask Siri how many ounces equals grams.  

Seems I'm sticking with Cronometer and I'm considering MyMacros+. Seems Fooducate's time has passed.

**********

Excellent, but I do wish there was an option to delete old scanned entries you don't wish to keep. This app actually has me eating better."

So when I stumbled open this I felt amazing! The app was well organized and as a played around with it I enjoyed the fact that I could scan foods in store to find out if they are healthy or not and why! This app taught me a lot about harmful things in Our everyday food and how to save money and be healthy! I especially like the tracker which is the first one I have ever gotten that works and preforms amazingly without having any charge. If you are looking to know what’s in your food and how to track and improve your health download fooducate (lol I sound like a ad) this app is awesome!!

6456826236,2020-09-22 09:40:32-07:00,The Runaway Robot,2,A good idea done badly,"The company seems badly understaffed. Nutrition scores and entries are highly uneven and not apparently made by well-qualified people familiar with current diet and food trends. Lots of items that have been on the grocery store shelf for years are unrecognized in this app but easily found in My Fitness Pal or FitBit. Then the developer wants you to do the work of photographing it and listing all the nutrition info and sending it in. Kind of like paying to have your car repaired at the mechanic’s shop then being asked by the mechanic to repair it yourself to “help out”. Then one must still wait weeks, sometimes months before the info you send in is finally added to the listing. They notify you when they add the info you sent but in many cases it was so long ago I literally had forgotten I sent it. They recently did a (rare) update with major, unneeded, changes to the UI when what they should be doing is getting their listings up-to-date, consistent, and judged by a highly-qualified nutrition expert familiar with today’s eating and health trends. Then they encouraged feedback about the changes in the update listing *without giving an email address or any other way to give that feedback*. Thus this review. One of my feedback points would have been that they made the main rating score of each item much smaller and harder to read. How is that better? And the new UI requires more clicks to see the same info. How is that better? Why do app developers think “improvement” just means rearranging the same info but not improving the actual content? It’s a frustrating app to use in many ways with only glacially slow, haphazard changes that may or may not be improvements. It’s a really good idea done badly, sorry to say. For example, I like that they actually show a photo of the product. This is better than My Fitness or FitBit and can be a real time saver. But a lot of the photos are so small or dark as to be useless. The search function has long needed upgrading to be more intelligent. I would like to support it with a higher level of membership but I cannot in good conscience pay more for bad service or pay to be asked to do the work the app people should be doing. I would love to see someone take over this app and really execute the ideas well. It could be outstanding."

6446494614,2020-09-19 12:14:00-07:00,ChzAnother,1,Terrible,This app is absolutely horrible. I don’t know why were paying 30 some dollars a year to do all the work. They don’t have foods entered into the system that are very popular. So for most foods you have to wait for it to show up in the system. The only foods that show up are the junk food that you’re trying not to eat anyway. Also the inner face really makes you not want to enter your food. To say it’s frustrating would be an understatement. It’s absolutely terrible. I will not be renewing at the end of the year. There’s got to be some app cobbled together by an elementary student for science fair that is better than this.

6415199027,2020-09-10 09:31:30-07:00,Bkst4,1,Frustrated,I started this app in hope to loose some weight and for me I need to do something everyday to keep me going. For me with this app it was posting. However The app decided to censor me and stop me from posting.  It said I disobeyed the terms and agreements but I did not! I look over the terms and agreements and I did nothing wrong. Now I can do anything on the app besides log my food or weight. I am so very frustrated about this. If the app could fix this I would greatly appreciate it.
6414621561,2020-09-10 06:18:35-07:00,Stvnjs,5,A very useful tool,"I have struggled for years to lose weight. Sometimes successfully, other times, not so much. I have found Fooducate to be a much more useful tool than others I have tried. The thing is, its on me to actually enter in the food I’ve eaten and this app makes it very easy to do so. I also love how it figures out the calories I need to reach my goals. The grades for food are extremely helpful when at the supermarket trying to determine what I should or should not buy. Lastly, I like that it gives me alternatives to the “bad” foods. That way I can make up my mind if I want an apple or a highly processed bar of some kind that might be labeled as healthy but in reality is not."

It pushes weight loss and management tips and goals really hard when eating healthy doesn’t have to be tied to being unhappy with your body. I like my body and my weight and just want to eat healthy and take care of it. Also, you have to pay to set your dietary preferences as vegetarian or vegan? What?"
6352681195,2020-08-23 09:11:05-07:00,Tpuhl17,2,Long time user,"Loved this app when I started using nearly 8 years ago. 5 star loyal customer. Now, I have way to much food data that clutters up my “recent” foods with no way to delete them. I’ve asked, but still don’t know why users can’t delete foods from their data. 

The foods get sorted by snack, breakfast, lunch and dinner based on your meal times determined in your settings.  However, it doesn’t take into consideration I might enter my breakfast meal long after I’ve had breakfast.  For example, I hate the exact cereal I’ve eaten every day of my life for the last 20 years @ 5:30 am, but never entered into Fooducate until 10:30am.  IF, I entered it at my breakfast time settings it would have been at the top of the list. However, since it wasn’t, and it rarely is, I literally scrolled thru 76 food items to get to a food I eat everyday. There were at least a dozen foods I passed I ate months ago for the first time and probably won’t eat again.

No big deal? After awhile doing that countless times day after day searching &  “scrolling” foods gets cumbersome, time consuming and very annoying knowing I have no control over the foods I see.

I’ve looked for similar apps to try and jump ship, but so far I haven’t found anything.  That’s not a ringing endorsement for Fooducate.  I’m actively looking.  It might be time to break up."

6122404039,2020-06-25 19:46:17-07:00,A Merry Berry,4,Way more in depth than other calorie counting apps!,"I’ve used some other calorie counting apps before, some of them even count macros like Fooducate, but none that I’ve seen offer such an in depth look at what you’re eating and what it means compared to fooducate. Not only does it outline your calories and macros, it also displays how much of your diet is being comprised of whole, unprocessed foods, grades each individual food choice, and explains every grade and what you need to look out for in your food. The app won’t just tell you “this product has xanthan gum in it, thumbs down,” it offers you an answer to “what the heck is this weird gum and why is it here?” You might even disagree with some of the grades depending on your preferences and goals, but since all the foods have an explanation you can decide for yourself if you want to disregard that or not. 

The only two reasons I took off a star are: 1) there’s a pretty prominent community feature but the community appears to be pretty dead. It’s hard to tell though because some discussions display the date each comment was posted, usually being around 2 years ago or so, and some of them give no indication of how recent it was. 2) there’s a weird point system that claims to be based off the “leading points systems” (so basically weight watchers but I’m sure they have reasons to not want to say it) but it seems to have no logical consistency. A bowl of Kale might be three points while a piece of chocolate might only be 1 or 2 sometimes. It’s generally easy enough to ignore, but these points tend to also be listed on the reasoning for a lower grade on the food which can be mildly bothersome if that’s not something you’re trying to consider. 

Overall really great app, I prefer it over my fitness pal and others like it, and I think it could be comparable with a greater, active community."
