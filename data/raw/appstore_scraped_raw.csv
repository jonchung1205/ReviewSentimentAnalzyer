But look, the notifications are a little annoying and creepy. Scince they were annoying when I first got the app, I deactivated them. But Duolingo just kept pushing me into reactivating them with a fake reward like “we will remind you when your energy bar’s full!” But it never reminded me of anything. It also send me a text saying “oh that’s VERY NORMAL!!! IGNORING YOUR STREAK IS CONPLETELY NORMAL!!” it’s kinda  creepy sometimes so be aware of that. Thank you for reading",❣️*-Z-*❣️,App Store

When a word appears, I press the audio button and say it. But after I speak, nothing happens. I can’t move to the next step. Even if I pronounce it incorrectly, it just stays on the same screen with only the audio button. It doesn’t allow me to continue.

I’m terrible with math so I’m doing the math as well. I’ve been learning chess and the chess lessons on here are the best and easiest to learn by far. I also play around with the music lessons.

Once I tried Arabic, a language I have no background in, the pedagogical flaws start to show. There isn’t a good explanation of how letters connect, there isn’t enough coverage of how the vowel sounds are different between the two languages. And after three days of lessons I have learned 0 praticle Arabic.
When I’m just stuck guessing which letters connect to make a sound clearly I am not/have not learned anything. Getting 10 XP for a five minute lesson just salts the wound of total demoralization.",randomcanon,App Store

570060128,2025-11-14 22:16:21-07:00,1,Energy vs Learning…less than one star,"Energy punishes those who want to learn.  There is only enough energy to do a few lessons because it depletes with each step, mistakes or not.  Now you have to stop the learning process to buy more energy or be bombarded with ads and still not earn enough to do another lesson.  Doesn’t help those who make mistakes either because they also run out of energy after just a few lessons. What were you thinking?  If you don’t start out with enough energy, EVEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY MISTAKES, you can’t complete a lesson because the energy depletes no matter what. Think you should go back to hearts and let the learning continue.","Dull,constricting",App Store
570060128,2025-11-14 21:53:22-07:00,2,Harder Than It Has To Be,"Generally I think this app does a decent job, but there are major frustrations. There are almost zero teaching/learning activities, which means you will go to Google often for answers to certain grammar rules that Duolingo doesn’t bother to attempt to teach you. It would be nice to have themed lessons over things like numbers, colors, parts of the body, etc. 

But mostly I am frustrated right now with two things. 1) I do not want to do the activities where you speak out loud to the AI. Not interested. Also not interested in started new friend streaks when I already have some going. So stop asking!! 2) The new “flash cards” activity is a great idea, but your speech recognition is terrible. Absolutely terrible. I can hear when I’m not repeating the words right, which makes it beyond irritating when your program counts words wrong when I say it, but then the “correct” pronunciation is EXACTLY what I just said.

I responded to the email which then suddenly disappeared from my screen. I went on the website to cancel again, which I then thought I had done. After looking at the emails I now got, I tried to see if there is a way to get refunded. I called the credit card, the agent suggested I try to get it from duolingo. I went back to see how and even found a telephone number. I like to speak to a person in cases like this. But alas it was just a message to do it online.

They teach you to shop in Italian on the web. On the web! Yes, they don’t trust Google webpage translations. I have spent fair amount of time in Italy and, seriously, no one says “carta di credito”.

570060128,2025-11-14 18:50:41-07:00,5,Very helpful!!^^,"I’m learning multiple languages at once, just cause it may be useful in the future. And Duolingo has really been helpful in this. The characters make it especially better for me though. I have a hard time focusing on something if it’s generic or too plain for me to have fun, but the characters have drawn and animated so uniquely and really add color to the app. I’ve tried other language learning apps, but I lost interest quickly because they bored me to madness. Another thing is that Duo has more than just languages, it teaches to read music, math, and now chess, and I think it’d  be dope if y’all added sign language as someone trying to learn it. One thing I wish though, was that we didn’t have the energy or heart thing, sometimes I go to do a lesson and I run out, and even though I want to keep learning, I can’t unless I pay for it, but I understand our lives or energy is a get-go for profit since it’s mostly a free app. Overall, if you’re thinking about learning a new language, Duolingo is definitely my top recommendation!

I have encountered two conversation activities that talk about women being girlfriends or women being married to women. Why do you have to do that? Just make it NORMAL. You’re not bringing politics into it; you’re not being religion into it, so why do you have to bring such a controversial topic into it? The other technical thing that bothers me is the listening feature for flash cards.

This is an incredible app to learn various languages and it has helped me better my Arabic and continue to refresh my French and German. The user friendliness of the app has also improved since I began using the app. 

I am not sure when the update happened, but I do not like the updated energy bar. I used to be able to use my lives, one per lesson and the recharge was much quicker and kept me motivated to learn. Now I have to wait over 12 hours for a full recharge, spend hundreds in gems or $13. In addition, the fact that if I run out of energy halfway through the lesson and will loose all of my XP due to not selecting one of the options above, is incredibly discouraging. The app now officially feels like the developers are putting profits first. I have introduced close friends and family to this app and want to continue to promote Duolingo, but unsure I will because it is harder to maintain the drive to learn with these energy roadblocks.",GBDavis2015,App Store

570060128,2025-11-13 16:13:58-07:00,5,Duolingo: Learning a Language Has Never Been This Addictive,"Duolingo isn’t just an app—it’s a little green owl that somehow makes learning a language feel like a game. From the moment you pick your language, you’re thrown into bite-sized lessons that are easy to fit into even the busiest day. Vocabulary, grammar, listening, and speaking all come together in a colorful, interactive way that keeps you hooked.
The gamification is genius. XP points, streaks, and tiny rewards make you feel like every lesson is a victory, and Duo, the owl, is both motivating and hilariously guilt-trippy when you skip a day. Plus, with dozens of languages (yes, even Klingon), there’s something for everyone.
It’s not perfect—advanced learners might find it shallow, and some exercises repeat a lot—but for beginners or anyone who wants to practice consistently, it’s almost impossible to put down. Duolingo doesn’t just teach words; it makes you want to learn them.
In short: it’s fun, addictive, and surprisingly effective. Duo the owl might just become your new best friend.",Lucy💀😝😛😜😚🤩🤩,App Store

570060128,2025-11-13 13:28:49-07:00,2,Major decline over the year,"I haven’t been happy with Duolingo the past year and think they took a massive step backwards. I actually cancelled my super subscription. I got tired of being pestered about Max even though I already paid for Super. I found a lot of the lessons became way too repetitive. I noticed that the Spanish course doesn’t have the cultural videos (explanations of grammar differences across Spanish-speaking countries) anymore and Stories are often repeated. Some courses like Swedish are neglected with bare minimum grammar lessons in the lesson notes and audio errors (example: car is “bil” but a different word is played when the audio is played) but flashy new animations and vibration patterns are often implemented instead. The speaking exercises often don’t pick up my voice properly so I end up shouting into the phone or skipping those.

570060128,2025-11-13 09:23:10-07:00,2,Music is horrible,"Update: I have now used the app for 976 days. I switched to Spanish and things are okay in the language area. I can tell things are improving frequently.

I’ve started using the music lessons and it’s abysmal. I’m using my own piano and there’s no learning, it’s just playing random songs. It also hears each note late, so I have to play the note off the beat, which is a horrible habit. Music is a disappointment for me.

I’ve been learning Portuguese on this app for 125 days.

The good: 
-They have definitely taken some psychology classes and mastered how to motivate me! I hardly ever forget daily practice (I have ADHD, so that’s a BIG deal).
-Each lesson is the perfect length. 
-The aesthetics and sounds are pleasing. 
-It’s super fun to root on and team up with my family members and friends who have the app.

The cnot so good: 
-In this learning phase it would be wonderful to have an original verb spelling reveal/clue link since that influences most of the latter forms. I have had to buy a Portuguese/English dictionary to look them up.
-They really need to install a vacation option. It’s really okay to take a break once in a while and not be penalized.
-The lesson and word priorities of the developers is baffling. Very early on (unit 4) they introduce animal names… I’m not sure why it is so important to know the Portuguese word for “shark”, “wolf”, or “armadillo” when I can’t even have a simple conversation in Portuguese yet!
- The spelling priorities are ridiculous too. If I only have 5 minutes per day to learn Portuguese, knowing how to spell tubarao (shark) and tatu (armadillo) is not a priority! Teach me how to ask for directions! Ask where a bathroom is! Ask where the airport or train is! Ask how expensive something is! Understand if a native speaker needs me to get out of the way or help in an emergency! I could go on and on. 
Hopefully one day there will be a questionnaire when one signs up so as to clarify WHY one is learning the language. Travel? School? Military? Brain training? Just for the fun of it? These are important factors. So far I can understand, “Cavalos amam a gente” (the horses love us), which is super useful if was visiting Brazil or Portugal and needed to find a hospital…",sunnycenterstreet,App Store

570060128,2025-11-13 06:30:53-07:00,3,Super frustrated,"First off, lately, I’ve been struggling with the widget. I’m putting this on top just because it’s been extremely frustrating and I hope maybe they’ll reply if they read this review as there is no direct way of getting in touch with the support team. It’s been turning black for the last couple months, and I have to restart my phone every time to fix it. It only fixes for a few weeks then I have the same problem again. I’ve sent a bug report, of course no reply. I’ve learned to rely on this for reminders to do my daily lessons.

Second, I’ve been doing this for 600 days now, and I do feel like I learned some German of course, I still have very little clue about the grammar because there’s simply no explanations or details about the reasoning behind different grammar rules. Duolingo leaves you completely on your own for this. Each individual exercise should have some explanation of the concept they’re trying to get across. This may be more pertinent to German because of the difficult grammar, I don’t know how it is for other languages. 

This is the same problem everybody else is complaining about. There used to be user discussion for each answer where you actually had some feedback from other people who may know better, but they took this away. 

With German it is imperative to learn the vocabulary together with the gender. Every other place I’ve gone for German emphasizes this. Duolingo failed to
do this, I do think it’s a big oversight. 

I’m too invested now to quit. I will finish the German course, but I will not use Duolingo again for anything else. I’m also telling everybody to try a different platform like babel instead of duolingo",11thplanet,App Store

The fact that each piece is in bite sizes really helps because it’s something I can do during a break from work or when I have a few minutes.

570060128,2025-11-12 21:24:14-07:00,3,An ok supplement to language classes,"Duolingo is ok as a supplement if you’re taking other language classes, but I wouldn’t trust it on its own to teach me a new language. Especially for language with their own alphabet or strict grammatical rules. I’m doing their Japanese lesson and they only require you to learn a certain amount of the katakana and hiragana before moving onto lessons, and it can get quite confusing if you haven’t gotten through all the characters, but it’s also next to impossible to reach the daily goals to earn XP if you just work on the characters. The free version makes it even harder to complete multiple lessons in a day to earn XP, as they changed from their “only lose a heart if you make a mistake” system to a “spend energy for every single question” system. You have to either watch several ads or spend 500 gems to replenish your energy enough to move on to new lessons. There are also weird issues with grammar and how some questions/prompts are worded that feels like AI was involved in making the lessons. I have no interest in learning a language from AI. 

I also had an issue with their end of trial reminder and them charging me for the Super subscription. I had to go through Apple for a refund, which thankfully I was granted, but their customer service was handled by AI which left a bad taste in my mouth. I don’t appreciate that my “reminder” was a push notification apparently sent in the early morning (when it would be easily missed), less than 2 days before the end of my trial. When I pointed out that the reminder came in later than it should have, Duolingo support didn’t acknowledge the error and just gave me repeat instructions on how to contact Apple for a refund (which it had already been acknowledged I’d received). It’s a small thing, but it’s frustrating. When I asked how people who don’t have push notifications enabled are meant to receive their reminder and if they could send reminders via email, I was told they didn’t “have specific information about” if that was possible or what happens if someone has notifications disabled. That seems like a glaring oversight. It just seems a bit scammy, like they are intentionally doing as little to remind users as possible so their trial will lapse, Duolingo will get their sub fee, and users will just roll with it because it’s more hassle to request a refund. I had previously had a Super subscription last year and liked the convenience of ad-free (I didn’t renew because my financial situation changed), but this recent issue just makes the company seem shady, and it made me rethink paying for Duolingo again in the future.",Aidan not Aiden,App Store

570060128,2025-11-12 19:28:51-07:00,2,From good to not so good,"A few months ago I began using Duolingo on a daily basis. I enjoyed the quick lessons and the ability to gain hearts (only when you made a mistake a heart would be taken) through ads or gems. This made it easy to do multiple lessons and spend lots of time on the app. 
The newest update has sadly made learning incredibly difficult. Instead of hearts there is now energy. The twist is that you lose energy every question you answer. No matter if you get it wrong or right. This means you can get through MAYBE one lesson, spending on how much energy you have. There is a huge push from the company to buy the plan. Understandable until you realize the original goal of the app (and motto that they use frequently) is to provide “free” language learning. Making an app in which it is too difficult to learn languages using the free version does not make the app “free.” 
I learned quite a lot with the hearts. I could get through numerous lessons and actually spend 30+ minutes on the app. Now if I spend 5 minutes on the app that is too much. 
Due to it taking so long to get through the different sections, the content does not change. I have not learned anything in at least a week. I feel stagnant in learning and am considering ending my lessons on Duolingo. I urge the company to take a look at how unhappy its users are and make a change.",Mag#hunter,App Store
570060128,2025-11-12 19:19:35-07:00,3,"It’s good, I’m learning, but…","So I’ve been learning Greek, Italian, and chess, and I just finished the first like, section of my journey to learn Greek and chess, Italian I am not as focused on. I am very annoyed about how after I just finished my first like level, that it has gotten very much harder and I am not able to keep up with the lessons anymore. The amount of ads is also insanely annoying. Also, you always run out of energy before you can complete as much lessons as you want. I can only do 2 to 3 lessons a day when I would like to be progressing much faster. I cannot afford to pay for super Duolingo and very annoyed at the benefits that people who can’t afford to pay for are getting while I am stuck with the version that gave me adds every five minutes and I can’t even complete a significant amount of lessons to easily progress. The first lessons were fun, but now that it has gotten much harder without any warning I am very lost. The first lesson for sure help me learn the language languages and Duolingo also provides other things you can learn chess math and music. The chess one is very useful and I’ve been learning a lot in it and I definitely recommend trying it out. All in all, if you are looking to learn a language, Duolingo is definitely the best language learning app I have tried, but you will definitely be annoyed with some of the things that you will experience while using the app as listed above.
