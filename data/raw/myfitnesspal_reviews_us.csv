13220161337,2025-10-03 16:48:35-07:00,Kberry777,1,Stop tracking exercises!,"Was great before putting the bar code scanner behind a paywall. Now, even after turning off tracking of every kind for mfp on my phone, it’s still somehow tracking my exercises and adding those calories back into my remaining daily total and the option to turn that off is also behind a paywall. Bar code makes sense even though I hate it, but the exercise calories being forced unless you pay is beyond stupid."
13220038927,2025-10-03 16:00:43-07:00,Hayala!,5,Fabulous App!,"I’m really happy that I can use an app like this that provides all my nutrition, exercise and goals in one place. Best part is - FOR FREE. Of course they have a premium addition. Which I’m sure has a lot more options but the free one is working fine for me for now. I look forward to logging in my meals and exercise each day. I’m already losing weight and I’ve only been using it for not even two weeks."
13219789707,2025-10-03 14:26:06-07:00,Cristycj,3,…,it would be nice if you could still have an option for tracking your cheat days and not get charged for it specially for the people that have a hard time tracking calories as it is his face. It’s not always easy.
13219605828,2025-10-03 13:20:55-07:00,tigress28_usmc,3,Good but issues,"There’s issues with the today yesterday and tomorrow portion I’m having crashing issues with the app just not opening and working and I have to open it two times before I Can get access to the app because it won’t let me log anything it just freezes and I don’t have time to open the app Two extra times and close it down and reopen it and close down and reopen it to lock my food it’s quite aggravating. It didn’t do this stuff while I was in my 30 day trial, but as soon as I paid for the app now I have issues."
13219552080,2025-10-03 13:02:41-07:00,MJ Dislikes,1,Steps,The app is great for keeping up with your calories but if you’re going to have the step counter on your app it should work and it doesn’t. Having my phone in my pocket when I walk it should count my steps and it doesn’t. Take it off if it’s not working
13219327823,2025-10-03 11:50:07-07:00,OH Fitness,1,Filled with incorrect data,This app is completely worthless in my experience. There are tens of thousands of foods with incorrect nutrition information. How does any use this app? It’s a joke. The current owner has done nothing to clean up the database.

13218959563,2025-10-03 10:01:29-07:00,Sdcurti,2,Too slow in loading,"While the app is a comprehensive tracking tool, the load time on my newest Apple phone is too long.  I push to open the app and have to set it down and move on to other things.  I’m hesitant to close the app.  Not cool."
13218422447,2025-10-03 07:41:17-07:00,Sriv666,2,Fixed!,"10/3/2025 update:  thank you!  You fixed the Diary section’s date problem.👍. Everything else is good.
———-
9/16/2025 update: it’s been a long time since I had an issue with this app, but somebody messed up the date area in the Diary section under the top tabs. It shows “today”, but when you touch the left arrow, instead of showing “yesterday”, it shows “tomorrow”, and hitting the right arrow, it  shows “yesterday”.  It’s backwards! If you hit the right or left arrow again, it shows the correct date (2 days before or after).  Needs to be fixed.
——————

6/12/2022 update:  I guess the issue below was fixed because I’ve been able to continue to use the app.  HOWEVER, the latest update seems to have removed the ability to track my weight!!  The “Progress” tab is gone!  That’s awful!  What are you guys thinking???
————

7/7/2021: This is the ultimate disappointment! I’ve been using your MyFitnessPal app for years, and now you’re telling me I can’t anymore because my iPad is too old. I tried the website, but I can’t find where to log my weight, plus it much more cumbersome. Please help! —————— Update 2/3/2021: comments below still apply. Another big issue is that when I do a search for a food, the you’d think the exact name that matches would be the first listed, but it’s not. Example: “lemon feta salad Wegmans” showed up on the second page down, even though it was an exact match. —————- I really like the fact that the food database contains many standard restaurant items, like Cheesecake Factory menu items, and also brand names, and there is great quantity flexibility. But many items have portions that are not defined, like 'container'--how many ounces or how many cups are in a container? It should also give you the choice for any time to use either ounces or cups (or parts thereof). As far as exercise, there are very few defined strength exercises, other than weight lifting. Strength exercises should also include ordinary everyday things, things like carrying groceries upstairs, carrying children, etc. which are not just cardio."

The latest bug I’m experiencing is on the weekly dashboard view, where the setting for “current week” shows the week ending 6 days ago, so to see the proper current week I have to slide forward by a week and then manually roll the date back by one day. It’s a pretty ridiculous workflow bug and something that worked well for a long time that suddenly doesn’t."

The communication between you and their IT department is delayed by several days so it takes forever to communicate with them to resolve an issue.

I wish they’d do it with actual numbers instead of percentages, but even though I’ve adjusted it for the amount I need it’s still inaccurate."

Developer reached out to let me know about an update to the incorrect dates issue which I appreciated(Which is fixed for me now)I had still chosen to not renew premium , however upon opting out of renewal, I was offered a discount (which I appreciated)to stay and so I did. The discounted price made the value hard to pass up so I opted to stay with premium. *old review: Continually gets worse.  As others have mentioned the days are all messed up. Yesterday is tomorrow. Today and tomorrow are both today. 2 days from now is suddenly yesterday. I will not be renewing the premium when they can’t get something as simple as the days correct."

Don’t get me wrong, when the app works and you can log in, it’s great. But during the two months that I have had the premium version I have lost access twice. The first time was for a day or so. The second was over a week. Their customer service was slow to respond l, often taking 1-3 days to reply and closing the ticket because of the slow response time. I asked for a refund but they said I need to talk to Apple about it because that is who the subscription is through. I have moved to another platform which is free and includes macro tracking. Save your money!"

13208498092,2025-10-01 03:08:52-07:00,PoizIvy,5,Full featured app makes it Easy to keep me on track,Dieting is a numbers game and MFPal gives me the data to see how what I eat and drink and exercise is affecting the scale and my size.  It encourages me to do well.  It’s easy to log food and information me what foods may push me off track. It has a large data bank of foods and I can scan packages to get more specific. I can log anytime of the day what I did and when I ate and fasted if I was not able to at the time.  Other apps I’ve tried were not as full featured.

Recently, there had been a problem with the app opening to permit logging food. Several attempts may or may not open it.  Also, the data on calories submitted by users is often grossly inaccurate—-due to guessing or misreading labels?  If these problems would be addressed, the app could be given a 5 star rating.

I was charged without an actual approval. I just thought it was strange the way it was handled. I have tried calling because I’d like to talk to a real person but there’s no real person to talk to.  I was given an email address and no reply there either.  I didn’t even give my cc#.  I don’t have my Apple account set up that way either. Years ago I did.  All strange how this was handled to me. Maybe I’ll get a response this way

Had at least 150 day streak going, which is helpful to motivate you when you don’t feel like continuing. Everything was fine until one day my days of the week were out of order. Instead of hitting the left arrow to switch to yesterday, that would take you to tomorrow. Hit the right arrow and today pops up twice. then yesterday, if you hit it again. It won’t save my logs. My streak ended even though I had logged every day. I notified the development team and they let me know they’d work on it. the ticket will show as closed, but i should know they’re still working on it. - That’s great, but now my streak is gone and i have no way of knowing how many days i logged and have no way to look back at those daily logs, the week of the issue happening. - I’m now using another app which i really don’t like.

As of perhaps the middle of Sep’25, the relative dates of “today”, “tomorrow”, and “yesterday” are mixed up, and weekly diary summaries are entirely incorrect—my guess is these two issues are related. As of today, barcode scanning is also broken. So if you like easily scanning in barcodes and reviewing your week, this is no longer the app for you."

It shows today, today, and then yesterday and all sorts. I contacted support and allegedly this bug would be fixed in their next update, whenever that is. Today I went to log my second thing for the day and had to log myself back in and my journal was wiped. My macros were wrong for the day but it was definitely still my account showing my 90lb weight loss and my face. My recipes I’ve been logging since July, gone. I thought I was on the wrong day because the glitch throws me off sometimes because I try to be on top of this, I’ve lost 100lbs in the last year and in July I decided to begin counting my calories and macros. To have these glitches linger with no customer service except for a virtual agent or emails is disheartening to me and not at all what I paid a year in advance for. While MyFitnessPal took days with emails to give me the run around and say eventually and soon, Apple took 20 minutes with a link and a phone number to give me my full refund which I wasn’t expecting. For an app of this size and age I expected so, so much more."

As of today, 9/23/25, I’m not able to toggle through days forward or backward in my diary. I missed inputting dinner last night so I tired to go back.

I updated the app, uninstall/reinstall, and still the issue persists. I’ve been able to use this app to help me track meals and lose, so far, 20 lbs.

I wish it just stayed on my food log page."

And occasionally when I check in during the day, my progress from that day and the days before disappear as well, so I have to continue signing out and back in and screen shotting my calories from the previous days to report them just in case they disappear."

Talk about an app that motivates you… NOT! Yes, you can use a special webpage where you can request the counter to be corrected, but why? We are busy, why don’t you allow a little slack. Why do you think some of us have been logging for years?!?! But the latest problem (do a google search) is the widespread issue of not having you log on the correct day. When you open up the diary to log today’s food, the date is wrong. As a matter of fact, “TODAY” is indicated as today, yesterday and tomorrow as well! What?!?! . And if you keep on scrolling into the future, “yesterday” will appear, just like 4 (!) days in the past. They posted a message saying they are working on it. It’s been there for some time."

It has been incredible to watch what was a great app be slowly made worse over time. Every update seems to make me more frustrated. Features that use to be free are now locked behind a pay wall (as if anyone needs ANOTHER subscription cost these days). Features that use to work flawlessly are now broken. The UI changes make the app harder to navigate. 9 years ago this app was perfection so it has truly been baffling to see this all go downhill. 


While my streak has kept me around years past where I would have jumped ship on any other app, I might finally be at the point where I tap out. 

3 stars (rounding up from 2.5) because the app DOES work- I can get a basic idea of my calories intake. In 2025 though there are many free app options offered that can provide you with a less clunky experience."

Fixing bugs & adding improvements doesn’t always mean a redesign of the entire platform is better.

It gets better. I lost access to my premium account. No one from MyFitnessPal is helping me. I’ve tried everything to log into it still can’t 🤬 I’ve emailed numerous times with zero success and I still can’t get my money back. Again worst experience I’ve ever had with any app."

The core feature — food logging — is flat-out broken. The database is stuffed with duplicates, outdated entries, and completely inaccurate information. Searching for something as simple as “chicken breast” is an ordeal, and even then the results are wrong half the time. This is supposed to be the most basic part of the app, and it’s a disaster.

The app itself is slow, glitchy, and gets worse with every update. Layout changes make no sense, useful features vanish, and navigation feels clunkier than ever. It’s like they’re actively trying to ruin the experience.

What really stings is that I’ve paid for Premium for years and gotten nothing but frustration in return. If this is what the “improved” version looks like, I can’t even imagine how bad the free version must be. I feel ripped off and let down after investing so much time and money here.

I’m canceling Premium, deleting the app, and moving on to something that actually works. MyFitnessPal has become a complete embarrassment."

I’ve bought ingredients that it never tells me how to use in the dish, which is a waste of time and money. The UI is terrible.  I’ve tried looking at other things I can use the app for, but it’s not intuitive. But I bought it, so I’ll use it for what I intended."

Yesterday is tomorrow, tomorrow is yesterday, and you have ‘today’ for 3 days straight when scrolling through the food diary. Also, no matter what I do, the app REFUSES to stay connected with Apple Health. I connect and connect and connect to it, Apple Health has all the permissions set, and FP continuously claims it isn’t connected!! My workouts are no longer being tracked, the food diary is all messed up and I am beginning to wonder if k can trust this app. I feel like I am being forced to upgrade to premium plus so features I have paid for and used for years will work again! Extremely frustrating! I have also uninstalled and reinstalled, in the hopes that this would correct the issue, but it persists. If these issues aren’t resolved soon, I am going to have to find a new app to use, which is a shame, but with as messed up as this app is now, I certainly can’t justify upgrading to a more expensive subscription level."

 It’s not the perfect app. I’m retired, living on a budget. It’s too expensive for me to use the features that are advertised. But there is a free section to track your calories and water. Even your workouts. What’s more, it’s the only app I’ve found so far that allows me to track my time on my air bike, although I haven’t found a way to specify levels of intervals. I’m going to try working with the free part of this app for a while.  It’s not ALL about getting into our wallets!"

What does surprise me is how so many features are now behind a paywall. You want to check your macros, “Go Premium”. You want to scan a barcode to enter your food intake, “Go Premium”. In the time I have returned I thought there would be some improvements to old problems but no. The app still doesn’t log any calories for weight training. The app design is essentially the same with no substantial evolution. Overall, the app is fine but it is disappointing to see that within the last few years there are no real beneficial changes that have been made."

It’s not intuitive in any way and features that used to be free are now part of the “premium” tier. And now they’re taking away more things that used to be free and charging for them. 
As far as functionality, the days are all messed up. The frequently logged foods just don’t show up for some reason. Like my vitamins are the same every single day. Why do I have to search for them every time? I cannot wait to go back to the other app I was using before. The one that actually makes sense and has everything available for free.

13119649896,2025-09-09 21:42:22-07:00,AnneTrojan,1,Wrong dates,Please fix it ASAP. The 7 days view is completely wrong. Some individual days are also wrong!

13118882316,2025-09-09 16:07:55-07:00,Yrensomar,1,What’s up with the bombarding of pop up ads,I have been using this app since 2017 more or less. Never had an issue with a darn pop up ad in the middle of documenting a meal or a workout. Now it’s an all the time annoying occurrence. Way to ruin something good.

Yesterday reads tomorrow..tomorrow reads today, etc., etc.!!! Extremely annoying!! I went to “troubleshooting” and it is listed as fixed..but it is not!! Have uninstalled and reinstalled app, still, to no avail!!"
13118051494,2025-09-09 10:49:46-07:00,Red19!!!,1,What happened?!?,"This app USED to be sooo good. Once upon a time, I could find almost any product, make my own recipes quickly and efficiently, and adjust the portion size. Now, it’s 200 listings of one brand with the only variations being the TYPOS and missing macros. Trash. Just trash. Congested, sloppy interface, too. Pick a different app to track your macros! Not this one."
13117885617,2025-09-09 09:55:09-07:00,ALAV2457,1,Not worth the price,"I doubt that I would be using this app even if it were free, but I tried it and was very disappointed with the way it tracks calories. When logging in a certain type of food, you’ll sometimes find a different calorie count for the same quantity of the same food. It overall ends up being a lot of work for something relatively arbitrary, unhelpful and completely useless. Considering the price, I would at least expect more functions and clear calorie counts."
13117257251,2025-09-09 06:47:04-07:00,Carl Loid,2,Disappointed,Every day I am looking for the app update saying they fixed the recipe saving issue. Unfortunately it’s not fixed and the feedback from support makes it seem like it won’t be for a while.  I downloaded the app to make tracking easier but calculating all my macros from my recipes myself is not easier.

Both the current and upcoming days read “today” and the previous day reads “tomorrow.” This would be very confusing if I wasn’t extremely disciplined about logging my food so I know the days just by looking at my stats but not ideal Especially for new users! and such a weird bug to occur after years of basically no problems

13114594932,2025-09-08 12:40:23-07:00,Thor340,1,I don’t get it,I’m not sure why I’m even trying to give back after all the slights from MFP. With the recent updates the dates won’t even work…. It shows yesterday and tomorrow and tomorrow as today like this is basic. Aside from not being able to scan barcodes for free after giving ALL of our food data for free to them is absurd. This might be the final death rattle of MFP until someone else gives the consumers what they want. Shame.

13114379468,2025-09-08 11:23:57-07:00,Amystar1,3,Can’t enter breakdown of food you add,I have used this app for years. Now when I add a food item you can only add the calories. If you want the carb and fat you have to pay?  Come on. Weight loss is hard enough and when you are really trying it makes you feel defeated that the tool that is supposed to help you makes you pay.   And premium plus is $20 a month? Ridiculous. I’m looking for something else.

13114084573,2025-09-08 09:45:36-07:00,DaveS1955,4,Has issues,This is a decent app but it has its issues.  When viewing something in the meal plan the trying to go back to the diary or dashboard the app locks up and you have to close it completely and then come back.  I subscribe to premium + and lockups are something that was not listed in the leeks or features.  I am running the current iOS on an iPhone 16.
13113992435,2025-09-08 09:16:27-07:00,Evil Otto722,3,Loss of widgets downgrades value,"A recent change to the application resulted in the widgets no longer being available. This change, while I'm sure it made sense to them or maybe it's a bug, removes the value of being able to quickly access my calories, my food, my nutrition, et cetera. I was disappointed to see this blacked out on my screen and no longer see the value in using this app going forward. When it comes time to renew my subscription, I'll look at all capabilities of other applications to see if similar widget-based functionality is available. Hopefully I'll see it return, but in the meantime, it's a good app though cumbersome and limited without the widgets being available to quickly see various nutritional details I like reviewing on a regular basis without jumping into the app."

Bottom line they want your money app doesn’t want you using for free.

When go to Diary -> select Nutrition -> select Weekly View: it does not populate the correct dates of the week, showing inaccurate weekly averages.
