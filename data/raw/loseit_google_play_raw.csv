I can eat 300-1000 less calories below budget per day so ive been able to lose 3-4 pounds on some weeks. and the premium benefits are pretty good lots of stuff. i don't use most of it but definitely worth the price. also if you time it right you can get lifetime for fairly cheap.,4,17.3.601,,

f7cce081-3be9-4575-993a-0268e7e429fb,Rob D,2025-05-11 01:12:32,3,Love this app. Use it in conjunction with Fitbit to track my calorie intake vs exercise. Works great for me. Update 5/7/22 - this so had gotten so slow I'm thinking of dumping it. Painfully slow. Update 5/11/25 - another failed attempt to show ads - THAT DON'T GO AWAY. The developers need to use their own app and TEST updates better.,4,17.2.702,,

f6c39c7d-1e79-4f97-8f7d-09a1ba0d04ea,Gwendolyn Eve,2025-05-10 17:59:33,4,Being on a pretty strict diet I really love this app. Being able to search foods on the go and custom recipes etc is such help. The only thing is I've noticed the odd glitch in an item where it would move the decimal point over one...for example a food has 3 carbs in it but occasionally when I choose that food it will register it as 0.3 instead causing me to have to re-add the item. If the developers fix that I will give 5 stars!,3,17.2.602,,
