It's very buggy when adding a new meal and often deletes it halfway through which is annoying(Now I cannot edit any meals). The AI for detecting meals and ingredients doesn't work well at all. Also the barcode scanning is for premium, bad.",5,25.34.0,"We are sorry to hear you are not enjoying the current experience.

Now it is slow as hell and it doesn't 'remember' your most recent inputs. I used to be able to quickly find items that I eat every day. Not anymore. Now I have to search for them every single time. It's a joke. This app is a joke. Why did they 'fix' something that didn't need fixing? I'm going to look for another app and I suggest everyone do the same unless they can fix these problems.,8,25.34.0,"It sounds like you may be encountering a new bug.

It was the most useful app to track calories, but little by little, more features became hidden behind paywalls, it is riddled with ads that make it glitch (but promises them to go away if you pay), and it is became less functional.
