The ability to create ""meals"" separately from your daily intake.

Unless I'm using the app wrong, right now I have to add all the ingredients to my daily intake and then choose to add it as a meal.  #2.

Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a ""low fat"" profile.",7,5.24,"Hi Kate, thank you for your detailed feedback! The app is relatively simple to navigate, but please feel free to email us at support@fooducate.com with additional details on what changes you'd like to see.

Being able to save frequent food combos as a meal is a real time saver. I would give it 5 stars if it had these features: A way to save individual foods as My Foods, or Favorites. A Search feature for Recent, My Foods, and My Meals, as these lists become quite lengthy. A nutrional breakdown by meal in addition to the daily totals so Diabetics can track the carbs by meal.",21,5.22,"Hi Debra, thanks for the review and feedback! We offer a feature to save your meals (frequent food combos) and to mark a food product as a favorite. Please reach out to us at support@fooducate.com so we can help you further.
